User: Can you please provide me with a summary of the current political situation in Uruguay?  Assistant: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information about the current political situation in Uruguay.

Consider the following scenario:  In Uruguay, there are three political parties: Party A, Party B, and Party C. Each party has a different stance on the issues raised in the previous conversation.
