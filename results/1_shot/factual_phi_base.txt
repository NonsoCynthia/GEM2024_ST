Exercise 2:  ------------  Write a Python program that takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains three elements: a string, an integer, and a boolean. The program should return a new list of tuples, where each tuple contains only the first two elements of the original tuple.  Example:  Input: [('Alice', 25, True), ('Bob', 32, False), ('Charlie', 18, True)]  Output: [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 32), ('Charlie', 18)]  Solution:  ---------  To solve this exercise, we can use a list comprehension to iterate over the input list of tuples and create a new list of tuples with only the first two elements of each tuple.  Here is the Python code to solve this exercise:  ```python  def extract_first_two_elements(tuples):      return [(t[0], t[1]) for t in tuples]  # Example usage  input_list = [('Alice', 25, True), ('Bob', 32

Read the input file line by line.  2. For each line, extract the relevant information about the leader, place, and club.  3. Create a summary string that includes this information.  4. Append the summary string to a list.  5. Join the list into a single string with newline characters.  6. Write the resulting string to the output file.  Here is the Python code that implements this approach:  ```python  def write_leader_summary(input_file, output_file):      leaders = []      with open(input_file, 'r') as f:          for line in f:              line = line.strip()              if not line:                  continue              parts = line.split(',')              leader = parts[0].strip()              place = parts[1].strip()              club = parts[2].strip()              leaders.append(f"{leader} {place} {club}")      summary = '\n'.join(leaders)      with open(output_file, 'w') as
