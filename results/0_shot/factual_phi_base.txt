Consider a hypothetical scenario where we have a list of movies with their corresponding details such as imdbId, director, and star(s). This data is stored in a JSON file named "movies.json". The structure of the JSON file is as follows:  ```json  [      {"imdbId": "0004319", "director": "Cyril_Bruce", "starring": ["Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)"], "title": "McVeagh_of_the_South_Seas"},     ...  ]  ```  Your task is to write a Python script that reads this JSON file and generates a summary for each movie following the same format as in the example above.  Question: What is the Python code to read the JSON file and generate the movie summaries?  First, we need to import the `json` module in Python which provides methods to work with JSON data.  Next, we need to read the JSON file using the `json.load()` method. This method returns a Python dictionary representing the JSON data.  Then, we iterate over each movie in the JSON data. For each movie, we extract the imdbId, director, and star(s)
