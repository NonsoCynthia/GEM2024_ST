Generate a story about a person who discovers a mysterious object in their backyard.  ## INPUT  ##OUTPUT  Sophie had always been fascinated by the old oak tree in her backyard. She loved to sit under its branches and watch the world go by. But one day, as she was digging in the dirt around the base of the tree, she discovered something strange. It was a small, metallic object that looked like it had been buried for years.  As she picked it up, she felt a strange energy coursing through her body. She couldn't quite explain it, but she knew that this object was special. She took it inside and examined it closely. It was a small, rectangular device with a series of buttons and dials.  Sophie spent the next few days trying to figure out what the device was and how it worked. She read every book she could find on electronics and engineering, but nothing seemed to make sense. Finally, she decided to take it to a local expert.  The expert examined the device and told Sophie that it was a prototype for a new kind of energy source. It was still in the early stages of development, and no one had ever seen anything like it before. Sophie was thrilled. She knew that this discovery could change the world.
