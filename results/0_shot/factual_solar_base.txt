Title: Chasing Destiny  Genre: Drama/Romance  Logline: When fate brings two strangers together during a chaotic New York City blackout, they embark on a journey of self-discovery and unexpected love.  Synopsis:  Act 1:  In the bustling city of New York, Emma, a struggling artist, and Jack, a successful investment banker, find themselves caught in a massive city-wide blackout. Unable to return home, they seek refuge in a dimly lit coffee shop where their paths cross. Initially annoyed by each other's presence, they reluctantly team up to navigate the darkened streets. As they share their life stories, they realize they have much more in common than they initially thought.  Act 2:  Over the next few days, Emma and Jack continue to spend time together, exploring the eerily empty city. Emma encourages Jack to pursue his long-forgotten passion for painting, while Jack helps Emma overcome her creative block. Their friendship blossoms into something deeper, but they both hesitate to act on their feelings due to their vastly different lifestyles.  As the blackout continues, Emma and Jack learn about the hardships faced by the city

A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees, has grown and moved to the city. One day, George uses his ape-strength to save a woman from a mugger. After reading about the event in the newspaper, Ape decides to travel to the city to find George. He meets Caroline, a human female interested in animals and wildlife, and who takes the ape into her home. Caroline's dog, Stu, is jealous of the attention that Ape receives and initially turns to hostility, fear and violence before learning to warily trust the ape. George and Caroline eventually fall in love, but their relationship is hindered by George's inability to fully shake his ape habits, such as climbing trees and attracting other females. In time, however, he largely overcomes these shortcomings. George, as an employee of the owner of a large monkey cage (W

The sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro has been spotted once again, this time undergoing testing at General Motors' Milford Proving Grounds in Michigan. This latest sighting comes just days after the car was spied during high-speed testing at Germany's Nürburgring.  The new Camaro is due to be revealed early next year, most likely at the Detroit Auto Show in January, and will go on sale as a 2016 model. It's part of GM's plan to roll out a new generation of its iconic muscle car every five years, with the current car having been introduced for the 2010 model year.  As we can see from these latest spy shots, the design of the new Camaro appears to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The proportions look largely the same as the current car but there are some notable differences. For example, the roofline appears to be slightly lower and the rear decklid features a more pronounced lip spoiler.  2016 Chevrolet Camaro spy shots - Image via S.

Stir in tomato sauce, water, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve over hot cooked rice.

Review: I bought this item for my wife for Christmas and she really likes it. It works great and she uses it everyday. The only negative thing she has to say about it is that the little case it came with doesn't hold anything else (like the charger and ear buds). That's not a big deal, though, because it's small and easily fits in her purse. We are very pleased with this item.  satisfied  Q: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The birth I had was exactly what I wanted (as much as a mom can control it). I would recommend this book to anyone planning a home birth. The stories shared in this book are really comforting and inspiring.The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because the second half of the book was not as useful to me. It had a lot of information for people who are more into crunchy-granola natural living (e.g. herbal remedies, whole wheat recipes, making your own products, etc.) None of that stuff really interests me, but if it does you, then this book is great!!

After reading the reviews, I made sure that I read the box before I left the store to make sure it was what I wanted. It said "ages 5 and up" creative fun for the whole family. So I assumed that it had everything in the box to make it work. When my son called me to ask me a question on how to get it to work, that's when I found out that it needed a battery that was not included. The only thing that should be left for the buyer to buy is the 9 volt battery for the remote control. He also told me that he had to take it apart in order for him to put the screws in. The reviews didn't mention anything about having to take it apart. Very disappointed in the fact that I had to go out and buy an extra battery for it.  dissatisfied  Q: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or diss

At first she would play with it for only a few minutes, but as she got older she played with it more and more. She is now 11 months old and plays with it every day for as long as 30 minutes at a time. As other people have mentioned, it really does encourage pulling up for babies working on that skill. It definitely boosted my daughter's confidence as she could pull up on it and it wouldn't tip over. I wish I had bought it earlier. Answer:  OPTIONS:  - No  - Yes  Answer: Yes  Question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This book is great for anyone who has watched all the movies based on Jane Austen's books and wants to "continue" the experience. Obviously, since no one knows Jane Austen's personal life in such detail, the book is entirely fictional, but provides a good bit of fun reading.

However, they differ in several ways, including how they function, their durability, and where they are used. In this article, we will discuss the differences between fuses and circuit breakers.  What is a Fuse?  A fuse is a safety device designed to protect electrical circuits from damage caused by excessive current flow. It consists of a strip of metal or semiconductor material enclosed in a non-conductive casing. When the current flowing through the fuse exceeds its rated capacity, the fuse element melts, breaking the circuit and preventing further current flow.  Fuses come in various types, such as cartridge, blade, glass, and ceramic, with different amperage ratings. They are commonly used in low-voltage circuits, such as those found in homes, cars, and appliances.  What is a Circuit Breaker?  A circuit breaker is another type of safety device used to protect electrical circuits from overloads and short circuits. Unlike fuses, which are disposable, circuit breakers can be reset and used again after an overload

A: I really wanted to like this place. It was close to home and had great reviews. But my experience was less than stellar. I made an appointment for a gel manicure and pedicure. The salon was empty when I arrived but two other people came in shortly after. The woman doing my nails seemed nice enough but she didn't speak much English so communication was difficult. She did an ok job on my nails but they weren't anything special. While she was working on my nails, another woman started working on my pedicure. This woman was very rude. She barely spoke to me and when she did it was with an attitude. When I told her I wanted the same color on my toes as my fingers she rolled her eyes and said "okay". When I asked her to trim my cuticles she gave me a dirty look and finally did it without saying a word. My pedicure was mediocre at best. There were several nail clippings left on my feet and the polish job was sloppy. I won't be going back.  Q: negative  A: Went here for lunch today. We were seated right away by a very nice hostess. Our waitress took our drink order and brought them over promptly. Then we waited...and waited...and waited.

In this time, we've witnessed firsthand how CSR has evolved from a compliance issue to a critical business strategy.  Today, companies understand that they can no longer ignore the role they must play in addressing society's most pressing challenges. To remain competitive, they must develop strategies that drive long-term value for all stakeholders – including employees, customers, communities and shareholders.  It's clear that today's consumers want to do business with companies that share their values. According to a recent Nielsen study, 66 percent of global online consumers are willing to pay more for products and services provided by companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact.  In other words, doing good isn't just the right thing to do – it's also good for business.  This shift in consumer expectations has led many companies to reevaluate their approach to CSR. As a result, we're seeing a new generation of CSR leaders emerge – companies that are integrating sustainability into their core business strategy and using it as a catalyst for innovation.  At Coca-Cola, this evolution is embodied in the company's World Without Waste initiative, which aims to help collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one

The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He rises from his bed wearing a fan T-shirt bearing the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he is out of cereal, his rat pet's food as well. He heads out to find a job by putting a "Man of Steel Extraordinary Powers Wanted" ad in the newspaper.In a noisy, crowded room full of people and bands playing, Billy attempts to speak with the receptionist listed on the ad's phone number. Aside from several awkward moments, the receptionist doesn't believe him either until Billy knocks a few aztec statues over as a demonstration of his superhuman strength. Billy ends up at the orphanage that Sara Lance (aka Black Canary) grew up in as both a home and a school and meets with the director before he is taken away by a police officer that the director called in order to deal with

A: I was really excited to try this place out since it has such good reviews. However, my experience was disappointing. First off, they were out of several items on the menu. We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer. They were soggy and greasy. For dinner, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was bland and the grits tasted like instant grits. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich. He said it was ok but nothing special. Our waitress was very friendly but our drinks sat empty for most of the meal. Overall, I was not impressed and will not be returning.  Q: positive  A: This place is great!  It's clean, bright, airy, and the staff is wonderful.  They have a nice selection of nail polish colors, and their pedicure chairs are super comfortable.  Both times I've been there, I've ended up falling asleep during my pedicure because they are so comfy.  They also have a nice selection of magazines to choose from.

Here is my attempt:  ```python  def sum_of_squares(numbers):      total = 0      for num in numbers:          total += num ** 2      return total  print(sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4]))  ```  However, when I run this code, it works correctly and returns the expected output of `100`. Is there anything wrong with my function or am I missing something?  A: There is nothing wrong with your function. It calculates the sum of the squares of all the elements in the list correctly. The issue might be with the environment where you are running the code or some other unrelated problem.  Your function can be shortened using Python's built-in sum function with a lambda expression:  def sum_of_squares(numbers):      return sum(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))  A: Your function is correct. However, you can optimize it by using the built-in

There were a few parts that didn't seem all that believable, but for the most part it flowed smoothly. A definite recommend for a leisurely read. Answer:  A: Positive  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Good value Review: This is a nice looking watch with a good feature set including countdown timer. The rotating bezel along with luminous hands and markers makes time setting and reading easire than typical 'business' style watches. It is somewhat large - typical of most casual watches, but this doesn't bother me.The main drawback is that the band is not great. It is not very comfortable and cannot be replaced on 'standard' pins by a third party. An aftermarket rubber strap would be a good option if you can find one.

The Longyangxia Dam Solar Park is located near the Longyangxia Dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and has a total installed capacity of 850 megawatts (MW).  According to Xinhua, the park consists of 4 million photovoltaic panels, covering an area of 8 square kilometers (3.1 square miles). The facility is expected to generate 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year, enough to meet the needs of more than 800,000 households.  The Longyangxia Dam Solar Park is also the world's first large-scale solar power plant built on a dam reservoir. The water body helps cool the photovoltaic panels, improving their efficiency by up to 25 percent, according to Xinhua.  Source: http://www.chinadialogue.

I no longer suffer from mood swings, brain fog, or cravings. I have more energy, and I sleep better.  The benefits of quitting sugar go far beyond physical appearance.

Input:  Darinka_Dentcheva  professionalField  Mathematical_optimization ,  Darinka_Dentcheva  almaMater  Humboldt_University   Output:   This is one of the most common questions we get asked by our customers. It's a difficult question to answer because there are so many factors to consider. In this article, we'll try to give you some guidelines to help you understand how much your website will cost.  The first thing you need to know is that there are two types of costs when it comes to websites: upfront costs and recurring costs.  Upfront costs are what you pay when you create your website. These costs include things like design, development, content creation, and domain registration.  Recurring costs are ongoing expenses that you have to pay regularly to keep your website running. These costs include things like hosting, maintenance, and software subscriptions.  Let's take a closer look at each of these costs.  1. Design  The cost of designing a website can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the design and the experience level of the designer. A simple, one-page website designed by a freelancer could cost anywhere from $200 to $1,000. On the other hand, a complex, multi-page website designed by a professional agency could cost anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 or more.  2. Development  Website development refers to the process of coding and building the actual website. Like design, the cost of development can vary widely depending on the complexity of the website and the

Input:  Andrew_Rayel  genre  Trance_music ,  Andrew_Rayel  associatedBand/associatedMusicalArtist  "Armin Van Buuren, Bobina, Mark Sixma, Jonathan Mendelsohn, Christian Burns, Jwaydan, Alexander Popov, Jano, Alexandre Bergheau, Jonny Rose, Sylvia Tosun, Lira Yin, Alexandra Badoi"   Output:   Q: How do I create a list of all occurrences of two specific characters in a string? I want to create a list of all occurrences of two specific characters in a string. For example, if the string is "Hello World", the output should be [(0, 'H'), (1, 'e'), (2, 'l'), (3, ' '), (4, 'W'), (5, 'o'), (6, 'r'), (7, 'l'), (8, 'd'), (9, '\n')]. The first element of each tuple represents the index of the character in the string, and the second element represents the character itself.  A: You can use enumerate with a list comprehension to achieve this:  string = "Hello World"  result = [(i, char) for i, char in enumerate(string)]  This creates an iterator over the indices and characters of the string, which is then converted into a list using a list comprehension.  To only include specific characters, you can filter the result:  specific_chars = {'H', 'W'}  result = [(i, char) for i, char in enumerate(string) if char in specific_chars]  In this case, the result will be:  [(0, 'H'), (4, 'W')]

The existing chain had worn out, so I decided to surprise my husband with a new chain for his cross. Boy was I surprised when I received this chain in the mail! I couldn't even spread the chain out on the table. The box was small and only 1 inch tall. I don't believe it was 20" in length either, but I didn't bother measuring it. The chain was cheap, short, and in no way worth the price I paid for it. Because it wasn't very expensive, I didn't want to waste even more money to send it back. I'll keep it but definitely won't buy from this seller again.  A:  dissatisfied

A: I was so excited to try this place after reading all the great reviews but left very disappointed. The food was mediocre at best. The hummus tasted like it came out of a jar. The falafel was bland and dry. The gyro meat had no flavor. The lamb kabob was decent but nothing special. The service was friendly but slow.

We ordered the crab stuffed shrimp, lobster bisque, and the seafood platter. The crab stuffed shrimp was really good. The lobster bisque was just ok. The seafood platter was HORRIBLE. The shrimp were overcooked and rubbery. The scallops were hard and chewy. The fish was ok. The lobster tail was probably the best part of the whole dish.   After we were done with our dinner, we waited another 20 minutes for our waitress to come back

He has always loved books so I thought it would be good for him to have a "fun" book in addition to his other board books. He absolutely loves this book. He loves to look at the pictures, lift the flaps and find what is underneath and he also kind of plays a game in his own way with recognizing letters, pointing at objects and saying what sound the object starts with. I never thought he would enjoy a book like this at this age but he does.

You have to use the keyboard to move the curser. Other than that it is a very good game. Don't forget its multiplayer so you can beat the heck out of your friends if they come over. If you have a ethernet cable you can play over that. GREAT GAME.  satisfied  (Question)  Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Not worth the money Review: I bought this book for my niece, but after receiving it, I gave it to my 2 yr. old son to look at because it was supposed to be "funny" and for "toddlers". He didn't like it either. Yes, the illustrations are nice and I suppose some little kids might think one or two pages are funny. But overall, it's definitely not a fun book. There are much better books out there for toddlers and for those slightly older children who can understand the humor. Save your money and get something else.  (Answer)  dissatisfied  Ques: Here is a

Mercedes-Benz is readying a new generation of its CLS-Class four-door coupe, and our latest spy shots show prototypes of the car undergoing winter testing in Sweden. The new model is expected to debut at the 2014 Detroit Auto Show in January, though some reports suggest it will make its world debut at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show in March.  The current CLS-Class has been on sale since 2011, so it's well overdue for an update. The good news is that the design of the new model is said to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, which means it should retain much of the elegance and sleekness of the original CLS-Class launched back in 2004.  Under the skin, expect the new CLS-Class to share its platform with the recently revealed 2014 E-Class sedan. This means it will feature a mix of steel, aluminum and high-strength steels to save weight, as well as a host of new features such as adaptive damping, air suspension, all-wheel drive, torque vectoring, and active roll stabilization

Specifically, this study examines the mediating role of employee engagement between HRM practices and organizational performance. This study was conducted using a quantitative approach with a survey research design. The population of this study consists of employees working in private companies in Jakarta. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires distributed to 350 respondents. A total of 324 usable questionnaires were returned, resulting in a response rate of 92.57%. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that HRM practices have a significant positive effect on employee engagement and organizational performance. Employee engagement partially mediates the relationship between HRM practices and organizational performance. These findings suggest that HRM practices can improve organizational performance by enhancing employee engagement. Thus, organizations should focus on implementing effective HRM practices to engage their employees and ultimately achieve better organizational performance.

Emgality is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand, which is believed to play a role and is considered a marker in the process of migraine attacks. "Today's approval provides another option for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults," said Eric Bastings, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Neurology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "The FDA continues to work efficiently to review new treatments for migraine to give patients with this disabling condition more options." The efficacy of Emgality was established in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with a history of episodic or chronic migraine. In all three studies, patients treated with Emgality experienced statistically significant reductions in monthly migraine days compared to placebo. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of patients

But after using it for a while, I realized that this item is not worth the money. First of all, the battery life is almost non-existent. I used brand name batteries and within 2 minutes, the battery was dead and I had to keep changing batteries way too many times. Secondly, the vibration pattern is limited to just one type of vibration. Some sort of variable vibration patterns would have been nice.

On the one hand it's a great concept because it holds everything (diaper, change of clothes, wipes, keys, wallet, bottle, formula, pacifier, etc.) in one bag and you can find things easily because it's roomy. However, I don't find it practical for the following reasons: 1) It's too heavy. Before I even put anything in it, it already weighed 2 lbs. Since the handles were somewhat small, the straps had to be over my shoulder causing an imbalance and making me lean to one side when fully packed. 2) When fully packed, as a sling bag, it was hard to figure out a way to carry it comfortably. 3) The total length of the strap was too short to be a comfortable sling (it kept coming up) and if I made the strap longer so that it was comfortable, then when I slid it off to the front to get something, it would slide all the way down to my feet.

I forgot that it has a lot of adult humor in it, so, while the kids were laughing hysterically at it, I was embarrassed. But, they absolutely thought it was the funniest movie ever. When it was over, the youngest said, "Let's watch it again".  Answer: satisfied  Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Very disappointing Review: This book reads like a novel. A very BAD novel. The plot is weak, the characters are undeveloped, the science is non existent, and the dialogue is painful

A: This place is great! I went here twice during my stay in Vegas. It's one of the only places open 24/7 so it's perfect for late night eats. The food is really good and the portions are huge. I got the chicken fried steak with gravy and hash browns and it was delicious. My friend got the corned beef hash which was also really good. The service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.  Q: negative  A: Food was ok but very overpriced. Service was horrible. Our waitress didn't even know the menu. We asked her what came in the kids mac n cheese and she said she didn't know. When our food came out they forgot part of our order and when we told her she acted like we were bothering her by telling her. She never refilled our drinks until we were almost done with our meal. Then when we got our bill it was wrong. We had a groupon and she charged us tax on the whole bill instead of just the difference. When we pointed it out to her she argued with us and said she couldn't take off the tax. Finally another employee came over and corrected the bill for us. Never going back.  Problem: What

With these enhancements, users can now solve more complex combinatorial optimization problems by incorporating multiple constraints into a single problem instance. This is expected to significantly expand the range of real-world applications where the technology can deliver tangible benefits.  Digital annealing is a computational method inspired by the physics phenomenon of thermal annealing, which is used to find the lowest energy state (optimal solution) in complex combinatorial optimization problems. It is particularly effective at solving large-scale NP-hard problems that are difficult to solve using classical algorithms.  The new enhancement allows users to incorporate multiple constraints into a single problem instance, making it possible to solve problems that were previously too complex to tackle with existing digital annealing technologies. This includes problems that require finding the optimal solution within a restricted search space defined by multiple constraints.

Title: Good but not great Review: The movie was layered with potential. The reality was a disorganized drama of a woman, Molly, played by Bridget Fonda. The real stars were her escort friends played by Selma Blair and Gina Gershon. Without them, there really would be no story. The writing leaves some parts of the movie unexplained such as the relationship between Molly and her husband which is portrayed as non-existent one and a loveless marriage. If their goal was to depict a true 'whore' then they succeeded. The lack of emotion displayed by Molly made it difficult to feel any emotion for her. By contrast, the scene

Chevrolet's sixth-generation Camaro is due to enter production later this year for the 2016 model year, but we're still yet to see the convertible version. Thankfully, our spy photographers have now managed to capture prototypes of the drop-top Camaro undergoing testing.  The new Camaro will once again come in both coupe and convertible body styles, with the latter offering a folding soft-top roof. We can see from these latest shots that the design of the top is similar to that of the current Camaro convertible, meaning there won't be any fancy retractable hardtop setup.  Under the skin, the new Camaro will ride on GM's Alpha platform shared with the Cadillac ATS and CTS sedans. This means the car will be lighter and more rigid than the current model, which rides on a modified version of the Zeta platform also used by the Pontiac G8 and Holden Commodore.  2016 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible spy video - Photo credit: Brian Williams/BrianWilliams.com  Powertrains will include a turbo

Emmet Walsh as various images of the Texas landscape are shown.

They seem to be discussing the fate of a woman they had met earlier, and despite Ray's pleas for Abby to reconsider, Abby throws a box off the bridge and mentions they will "have to do something" about the gas station attendant as well. In a seedy motel room, Earl (Dan Hedaya) awakens after being awakened by a phone call where he is told that a suitcase has been left for him at the desk. Earl is impatient to find out the contents of the suitcase and when he finds out it contains a severed ear, he calmly puts the ear in a glass of water before picking up a newspaper from the year 1958 and reading about a fortune in bonds that were never cashed. In a diner, Abby and Ray, along with their friend Lester (Christopher Allport), are having coffee when they discuss an upcoming concert by singer Sybil Ludinger (Ronee Blakley) that night.

Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe.  His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire.  At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belgrave Lodge Girls' School, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford named Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher.  Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1821 he was attending a school in Knutsford.  Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1826 he attended a school in Warrington. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and

Answer:  OPTIONS:  - No  - Yes  Answer: Yes  input with options: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I ordered this item because it looked perfect for my home theater setup. I live in an apartment now, but was moving, so I elected to have it sent to my mom's house to avoid a possible second delivery charge and hassle. When I recieved the unit, two of the knobs were broken and the shelving was not straight at all. The ship date on the unit was actually about a week AFTER my actual order date, so I believe that it was not a "new" item. There were fingerprints and wear marks all over the stainless part of the unit too. I had to disassemble it, repaint the shelves, and replace the knobs. It looks nice now, but what a pain! Answer:  OPTIONS:  - No  - Yes  output: No  Q: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Poorly Written Review: This book has a good story line, but is written poorly. The fact that it is written in first person past tense rather than present is very irritating. Many scenes are disjointed and hard to understand. The author does not do a very good job of painting mental images for the scenes in the book. The characters are somewhat flat and it is difficult to get to know and like them. Although there are some good parts, the book does not flow well and I am struggling to finish it. I am very surprised that so many people like it. There are far better books available.

I wish Anita Blake could have been one of my friends when I was in High School. She is strong, smart, capable, and independant; but also has her own vulnerabilities. I appreciate a strong female lead, but one who doesn't get too macho in a male dominated profession (vampire slayer) is difficult to find. Answer:  A: Yes  Q: Is this product review positive?

This is what I have so far:  app.filter('dateRange', function () {      return function (items, startDate, endDate) {          var filteredItems = [];          for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {              if (items[i].date >= startDate && items[i].date <= endDate) {                  filteredItems.push(items[i]);              }          }          return filteredItems;      };  });  The problem is that when I try to use this filter in my view, it doesn't seem to work. This is how I am using it:  <tr ng-repeat="item in items | dateRange:startDate:endDate">      <td>{{item.date}}</td>      <td>{{item.name}}</td>      <td>{{item.value}}</td>  </tr>  The values for startDate and endDate are defined in the controller.

In a news release Friday, the NRA said it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, even as its headquarters will remain in Virginia.  The move comes after Attorney General Letitia James sued the group last year, accusing leaders of fraudulently diverting tens of millions of dollars for lavish personal trips, no-show contracts for associates and other expenditures. The NRA has called the lawsuit a baseless, premeditated attack.  "This filing will permit the Association to implement its strategic plan to reincorporate in the State of Texas," the NRA said in its news release. "As part of this process, the NRA will be moving legal proceedings, including the case brought against the Association by New York Attorney General Letitia James, to the appropriate court in the Northern District of Texas."  James said in a statement Friday that her office "will not allow the NRA to use this or any other maneuver to evade accountability and my office's oversight."  "The NRA is not above the law and will not use shell games to avoid addressing its obligations to its members, suppliers, and

It flows nicely and keeps your attention. The only complaint I have is that they mention the "hands" and what they do for certain functions, but don't tell you what each hand represents. So while they say "the left hand adjusts the contrast" or something along those lines, they don't say, "the left hand represents the following menu on the LCD screen, etc.."

There are few books that can grab my attention and run with it, this one was able to do that easily. This is one book I will reread over and over again when I need to get away.

There are many different types of loans available, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your needs. Some common types of loans include personal loans, home loans, car loans, student loans, and business loans.  Once you have identified the type of loan you need, the next step is to assess your creditworthiness. This involves checking your credit score and credit history. Lenders will use this information to determine your ability to repay the loan. It's a good idea to check your credit report for accuracy and dispute any errors before applying for a loan.  After determining your creditworthiness, you should research and compare lenders. Look for lenders that offer loans for your specific needs, and compare their interest rates, loan terms, fees, and eligibility criteria. Choose a reputable lender with favorable terms that you can comfortably meet.  The next step is to gather the necessary documentation required by the lender. This typically includes proof of income, identification, residence, and debt obligations. Having these documents ready will make the application process smoother and faster.  Once you have selected a lender and gathered the necessary documents, you can then apply for the loan. This can usually be done online, over the phone, or in person at a branch. Fill out the application form accurately and completely, providing all the required information.

My parents took me to see it at a drive-in movie theater. I don't remember much about it other than thinking it was pretty good. When I saw it again recently, I enjoyed it just as much as I did all those years ago.  The film is set in 1968, during the Vietnam War. Two friends, Rake (Timothy Bottoms) and Johnny (John Saxon Jr.) are drafted into the army. They both want to go AWOL, but their friend Doc (Don Johnson) convinces them to report for duty. After basic training, they are sent to Vietnam, where they must face the horrors of war.  The film does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the Vietnam War. The battle scenes are intense and realistic. The characters are well developed and easy to relate to. The friendship between Rake, Johnny, and Doc is touching and believable.  Overall, 'The Dirty Dozen: The Fatal Mission' is a solid war film that holds up well even after all these years. It's worth watching for fans of the genre.

Their chips are always fresh and hot. I also enjoy their chili rellenos. It's a great place to go for a quick bite to eat.  Q: negative  A: Not impressed.  We had high hopes for this place but were very disappointed.  The food was just average and the service was lacking.  We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer and they were soggy and swimming in grease.  For entrees we got the turkey burger and the chicken sandwich.  The turkey burger was dry and overcooked and the chicken sandwich was just ok.  The sweet potato fries were good though.  Our waitress was friendly enough but she wasn't very attentive and took a long time to bring us our check.  Overall, there are much better options in the area.

Input:  BBC  city  Broadcasting_House ,  Bananaman  starring  Bill_Oddie ,  Bill_Oddie  birthPlace  Rochdale ,  Bananaman  broadcastedBy  BBC ,  Bananaman  firstAired  "1983-10-03"   Output:   This is one of the most common questions we get asked by our customers. The answer is simple – there are many factors that contribute to the cost of your new home.  One of the biggest factors is land size. The larger the block, the more expensive it will be to build on. Another factor is the design of the home itself. For example, a single storey home with four bedrooms will generally cost less to build than a double storey home with the same number of bedrooms.  The quality of materials and finishes you choose will also affect the overall cost of your new home. High-quality fixtures and fittings, such as stone benchtops and designer tapware, will add to the final price.  Another factor to consider is the location of your new home. Building in metropolitan areas can be more expensive due to higher land costs and council fees.  Finally, the builder you choose will also impact the cost of your new home. Some builders offer fixed-price contracts, while others may charge for additional services or inclusions. It's important to compare quotes from several builders to ensure you're getting the best value for your money.  In summary, the cost of building a new home varies depending on factors such as land size, design, materials, location, and the builder you choose. It's important to carefully consider all these factors when budgeting for your new home.

According to the report, the investigation began last year after Macmillan, HarperCollins, Penguin, Simon & Schuster and Hachette switched to an agency pricing model for their e-books sold through Apple's iBookstore. This pricing model allowed the publishers to set the price of their e-books, rather than letting retailers like Amazon set the price.  Prior to the switch, Amazon had dominated the e-book market by selling e-books at a loss in order to increase sales of its Kindle e-readers. When the publishers adopted the agency pricing model, they were able to charge higher prices for their e-books across all platforms, including Amazon's Kindle store.  In response, Amazon temporarily removed the buy buttons from Macmillan's e-books, preventing customers from purchasing those titles until the publisher backed down.  The DOJ's investigation is said to be focused on whether Apple colluded with the publishers to raise e-book prices. In addition to Apple and the five publishers mentioned above, the DOJ is also reportedly looking into potential collusion between Barnes & Noble and several smaller publishers.  Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

A: The food here is pretty good but the service is terrible. I have been here several times and every single time the service has been really slow. They always seem understaffed and when we finally get our food it's usually cold. We asked for refills on our drinks and never got them. It took forever to get our check and then they brought us the wrong one. When we finally got out of there it took another 10 minutes for them to process our credit card. Never going back.  Q: negative  A: This place used to be great.  Not anymore.  The last two times I have been here, the food was mediocre at best.  The first time, I ordered the chilaquiles.  The corn tortillas were soggy and bland.  The second time, I ordered the enchilada plate.  The enchiladas were decent, but the rice and beans tasted like they came out of a can.

Academic journal article The Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Studies  The Impact of Globalization on Developing Countries: A Critical Review  By Nwankwo, Chijioke Uchechukwu  Globalization is a multidimensional concept that has been defined differently by different scholars. For instance, Stiglitz (2006) defines globalization as "the increasing integration of national economies around the world through trade, capital flows, migration, and diffusion of technology and information" (p. 1). In contrast, Held et al. (1999) define globalization as "the widening, intensifying, and speeding up of global interconnectedness in four key dimensions: economics, politics, culture, and ecology" (p. 18). These definitions suggest that globalization is a process characterized by economic, political, cultural, and ecological interactions among nations across the globe. While some countries have benefited immensely from globalization, other countries have not fared so well. This paper examines the impact of globalization on developing countries.  Globalization and Its Dimensions  Globalization can be traced back to the sixteenth century when Europeans

It has been parodied, mocked, and used as an example of how not to start a story. But where did it come from, and what does it really mean?  The phrase "It was a dark and stormy night" first appeared in print in 1830 in the novel "Paul Clifford" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. The full opening line reads, "It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene occurs), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness."  Bulwer-Lytton was a prolific writer, producing over 70 novels, plays, and poems during his lifetime. While he enjoyed popularity during his time, his work is not as well-remembered today. However, the opening line from "Paul Clifford" has become a cultural punchline, often used to mock overly dramatic or clichéd writing.  Despite its negative connotations, the opening line serves its purpose within the context of the novel. The stormy night sets the

There were plenty of empty tables but we were told there would be a 20 minute wait because they were short staffed. We decided to sit at the bar since there were plenty of empty seats. Our server seemed rushed and did not seem to want to be there. She took our drink order and never brought them. We asked another bartender for our drinks and then placed our food order. The food came fairly quickly and was good as usual. When our server finally came over with the check, she acted put out that we had to ask someone else for our drinks.

The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG is one of our favorite cars here at High Gear Media. In coupe form, it's a car that combines classic gullwing styling with modern technology and power, making for a package that's both visually stunning and dynamically impressive.  So when Mercedes-Benz decided to drop the top on its latest supercar, we knew it was going to be something special. The result is the new SLS AMG Roadster, which has just been launched in Europe and will arrive in U.S. showrooms later this year.  To celebrate the launch, Mercedes-Benz invited us out to the Italian island of Sardinia to sample the car on some of the most exciting roads in Europe.  Aside from the addition of a folding fabric roof, the SLS AMG Roadster is identical to its coupe sibling. Under the hood is the same 6.3-liter V-8 engine producing 563 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque, driving the rear wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.  Performance figures are also the same, with the Roadster

I started working out with weights and doing cardio. However, I felt like something was missing. I didn't feel like I was challenging myself enough. That's when I decided to try CrossFit.  In October 2010, I did my first CrossFit workout at another box. As soon as I walked into the gym, I knew this was what I had been looking for. I loved the atmosphere, the camaraderie, and the intensity of the workouts. From that day forward, I was hooked.  CrossFit has changed my life in so many ways. It has made me physically stronger than I have ever been. I am confident that I can lift more weight now than I could when I was in my twenties. It has also made me mentally stronger. I know that if I set my mind to something, I can accomplish it. CrossFit has taught me discipline, determination, and perseverance.  Most importantly, CrossFit has given me a community of friends

Data science is the process of extracting insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data through the use of various analytical methods, algorithms, and techniques. In this article, we will explore the top trends in data science for 2023 and beyond.  1. **Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):** AI and ML technologies have already revolutionized many industries, and their impact is only set to grow in the coming years. These technologies enable machines to learn from data, improve their performance, and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In 2023, we can expect to see advancements in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and explainable AI.  2. **The Rise of Edge Computing:** With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is a growing need for real-time data processing close to where it is generated.

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health surveyed more than 2,000 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 years old. The findings were published in the journal Addictive Behaviors.  "Understanding the motivations behind adolescent drinking is important because it can help us better target prevention efforts," said lead author Dr. Mark E. Courtney, Ph.D., M.P.H., associate professor in Pitt Public Health's Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences.  "For example, knowing that many adolescents drink to fit in with their peers could prompt schools to develop programs aimed at promoting healthy social norms around alcohol use."  Courtney and his colleagues found that over half of the adolescents reported having consumed alcohol at least once in their lives. Among those who drank, the most common reasons included curiosity or interest (67 percent), to have fun (64 percent), to relax or feel less anxious (58 percent), and to fit in or belong (57 percent).

I am trying to write a recursive function that checks if an array is sorted or not. Here is my code:  public static boolean isSorted(int[] arr){      return isSorted(arr,0,arr.length-1);  }  public static boolean isSorted(int[] arr, int start, int end){      if(start >= end){          return true;      }      if(arr[start] > arr[start+1]){          return false;      }      return isSorted(arr,start+1,end);  }  The problem with this code is that it returns true for arrays like {1,2,3,4,6}. Can someone tell me where I am going wrong?  A: You need to check the condition for all the elements between start and end.  This can be done by calling the method recursively for the subarray between start and end.  Here is the corrected version of your code:  public static boolean isSorted(int[] arr, int start, int end) {      if (start >= end) {          return true;      }      if (arr[start] > arr[start + 1]) {          return false;      }      return isSorted(arr

But I did have a car, so I spent a lot of time driving around by myself. And when I drove, I listened to the radio.  One day, I heard a song that stopped me in my tracks. It was called "Lucky" by Jason Mraz, and it was unlike anything I had ever heard before. The lyrics were poetic and thought-provoking, the melody was catchy but complex, and Jason's voice was warm and inviting.  From that moment on, I became a huge fan of Jason Mraz. I bought all of his albums, went to see him in concert, and even learned to play some of his songs on the guitar.  Jason's music has been a constant source of comfort and inspiration for me over the years. His songs often touch on themes of love, hope, and self-discovery, and they always leave me feeling uplifted and grateful.  One of the things I admire most about Jason is his commitment to making a positive impact in the world. He's involved in numerous charitable causes, including environmental conservation and promoting peace through music.  In a world that can often feel chaotic and overwhelming, Jason Mraz's music serves as a reminder to appreciate the simple things in life and to strive towards making the world a better place. For introducing me to his music

The funding was made available through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreement program, which provides annual support to state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments to strengthen their public health preparedness capabilities.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) administers the PHEP cooperative agreement on behalf of HHS.  "This funding will enable states and territories to better prepare for and respond to public health emergencies," said HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) Robert Kadlec, M.D. "By supporting these efforts, we can enhance our nation's ability to protect the health and safety of all Americans."  Through this funding, states and territories will develop and maintain emergency operations plans, conduct community preparedness activities, and train staff to respond to public health emergencies. In addition, grantees will participate in national exercises to test their ability to respond to public health emergencies.

The staff is always friendly and the service is quick.  Q: negative  A: This place was very disappointing. We went there for dinner last night. The menu looked good but the food did not live up to expectations. For starters we had the crab stuffed mushroom caps. The mushrooms were bland and the crab stuffing tasted like imitation crab meat. Next we had the baked clams. The clams were small and the breadcrumb topping was dry and overcooked. For our entrees we had the Lobster Ravioli and Shrimp Scampi. The ravioli was ok but the shrimp scampi was terrible. The shrimp was overcooked and rubbery and the sauce tasted like it came out of a jar. Our waitress was attentive but she never asked us how our meal was

A swimming pool is a great way to cool off during the hot summer months, enjoy some quality time with family and friends, and even get some exercise. But did you know that owning a swimming pool can also increase the value of your home? That's right – according to recent studies, adding a swimming pool to your property can increase its value by up to 10%.  When it comes to selling a house, a swimming pool can be a major selling point for potential buyers. Many people view a swimming pool as a luxury feature that adds to the overall appeal and desirability of a home. This is especially true in warmer climates where swimming pools are more commonly used throughout the year.  However, it's important to note that the value added by a swimming pool will vary depending on several factors. These include the location of the property, the size and condition of the pool, and the overall real estate market. In some areas, a swimming pool may not add as much value as in others.  Additionally, it's important to consider the ongoing maintenance and operating costs associated with owning a swimming pool. These costs can vary depending on factors such as the size of the pool, the type of filtration system, and the cost of utilities in your area. It's essential to weigh the potential increase in value against

I have a dataframe with one column named 'date'. This column contains some dates in this format: 2021-05-13.  I want to create a new column called 'month' which will contain the name of the month instead of the number. For example, for the date 2021-05-13, the value in the 'month' column should be 'May'.  How can I do this in python?  A: Use DataFrame.apply with lambda function for custom processing per rows:  df['month'] = df['date'].apply(lambda x: datetime.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d').strftime('%B'))  print (df)              date   month  0  2021-05-13   May  Or if possible convert to datetimes and use Series.dt.strftime:  df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])  df['month'] = df['date'].dt.strftime('%B')  print (df)              date   month  0 2021-05-13   May  A: You can use pandas.Series.dt.strftime:  df['

The research, published in the Journal of Adolescence, suggests that playing violent video games is associated with an increased likelihood of physical, verbal, and relational forms of bullying.  "Our findings suggest that parents, educators, and clinicians should consider whether exposure to violent video games might be contributing to bullying behaviors among adolescents," said lead author Jeffrey D. Hancock, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Brigham Young University.  "If so, limiting exposure to violent video games could be one way to reduce bullying."  Hancock and his colleagues analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, which followed a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7-12 from 1994-95 through 2008-09. The researchers focused on students who reported playing video games during middle school (ages 12-14) and then

The website is designed to allow people to create their own customized gift cards using their own photographs. They can then print them at home or send them via email. The goal is to make it easy for people to give personalized gifts without having to spend a lot of time or money.  To achieve this, I have researched and selected a user-friendly platform that allows users to upload their images, add text, and customize the design of the gift card. The site also offers a variety of templates and backgrounds for those who prefer a pre-designed look.  The payment system has been integrated with popular payment methods such as credit/debit cards, PayPal, and Apple Pay. Users can easily select their preferred payment method during checkout.  In terms of security, I have ensured that all sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and personal information, is encrypted and protected using SSL encryption.  Lastly, I have tested the website thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or glitches that could hinder the user experience.  Overall, this project aims to provide a convenient and cost-effective way for people to create and share personalized gift cards with their loved ones. I am excited to officially launch the website and see how it resonates with our target audience.

The sample consists of 165 Chinese A-share listed companies for the period of 2009–2013. Using the Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, this study examines the relationship between cultural values and CSR disclosure. The results show that individualism is positively related to CSR disclosure, whereas uncertainty avoidance and masculinity are negatively related to CSR disclosure. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the impact of cultural values on CSR disclosure in the context of China.

Before he vanished, Henry entrusted the artifact to his brother, James, for safekeeping.  Determined to uncover the truth, Emma enlists the help of her childhood friend, Lucas Foster (37), an expert in ancient civilizations and languages.

Ensaf Haidar, who lives in Canada with their three children, said her husband had been moved to Dhahban Prison near Jeddah following a hunger strike by political prisoners.  Mr Badawi, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament in 2015, is serving a 10-year sentence for "insulting Islam" through his website.  He was also sentenced to 1,000 lashes, five of which were carried out in public in January 2015.  Ms Haidar told The Independent: "I am very worried about my husband's health. He suffers from several diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, back pain and kidney stones.  "His situation is very critical because he is held in solitary confinement in a very small cell with no bed, just a thin mattress on the floor."  She added: "I fear for his life."

Q: negative  A: This place is terrible. We had reservations at 7pm but didn't get seated until 7:45. Then we waited another 20 minutes before our waiter even came over to take our drink order. When he finally did come over, he acted like we were bothering him by ordering drinks and appetizers. He never refilled our water or checked on us once during our meal. By the time we got our food, it was almost 9pm. And the food wasn't even that good. My husband ordered the filet mignon medium rare and it came out more medium well. The broccoli was soggy and the mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box. I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp which was pretty good but nothing special.

Input:  HBO  timeshiftChannel  HBO East, HBO West   Output:   There are many reasons why people decide to invest in real estate. For some, it's a way to secure their financial future, while for others, it's a means to generate passive income. Regardless of the motivation, real estate investing can be a lucrative venture if done correctly. Here are some tips for first-time investors looking to get started in the world of real estate.  1. Educate Yourself: Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to understand the basics of real estate investing.

As a child, I used to daydream about going back in time to witness historical events or meet famous figures from the past. The concept of being able to manipulate time and space has captivated the imagination of countless writers, filmmakers, and scientists for centuries.  In fiction, time travel is often portrayed as a way to alter the course of history, fix past mistakes, or simply explore different eras. From H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine" to the Back to the Future trilogy, stories featuring time travel have become a staple in popular culture. However, the possibility of actually traveling through time remains a hotly debated topic in the scientific community.  According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time is relative and can be affected by factors such as gravity and speed. This has led some physicists to speculate that under certain extreme conditions, time travel could theoretically be possible. For instance, the concept of wormholes, hypothetical tunnels connecting two points in space-time, has been proposed as a potential means of time travel.  Despite these intriguing theories, however, there are still many obstacles to overcome before time travel becomes a reality. One major issue is the paradoxes that could arise from altering the timeline. For example, if someone were to go

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Disappointing Review: I had high hopes for this book, but it left me wanting. The two main characters were two-dimensional and uninteresting. The author tried to pack the story with action, but it came across as a haphazard series of events to move the plot along rather than something fluid. The faith of the characters seemed relegated to just a surface-level inclusion. Overall, it left me unsatisfied and glad I borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it. Answer:  (A).  Negative  (Q).  Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Great Book Review: This book is great for any teenager that has to deal with peer pressure, which of course, we all do. Ellen Portch wrote this in a way that you can feel what the main character feels. The use of words are incredible. The story line is so realistic and you can relate to it in your own way. It is a great book and I recommend it to anyone. Answer:  (A).  Positive  (Q).  Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Not worth the money Review: I bought these headphones because I read all the great reviews.

What is the Difference Between a Residential Treatment Center and a Therapeutic Boarding School?  When parents are faced with their teen's mental health issues, substance abuse, or behavioral problems, they often turn to residential treatment centers (RTC) or therapeutic boarding schools for help. However, these terms are often used interchangeably, leading to confusion about what each type of facility offers. In this article, we will explore the differences between a residential treatment center and a therapeutic boarding school to help parents make informed decisions about their child's care.  Residential Treatment Centers (RTC)  A residential treatment center (RTC) is a specialized facility designed to provide intensive, around-the-clock care for adolescents struggling with severe mental health disorders, substance abuse, or behavioral issues. These centers typically offer psychiatric care, individual and group therapy, medication management, and educational services. RTCs are licensed by the state and adhere to strict regulations regarding staffing, programming, and facilities. They often have higher staff-to-student ratios than therapeutic boarding schools, allowing for more individualized attention and support.

This study used a quantitative research design. A convenience sample of 100 undergraduate students enrolled at a four-year public university in the southeastern region of the United States participated in this study. Participants completed the General Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) and the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (Pajares, 1996). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients. Results indicated that there was a significant positive correlation between general self-efficacy and academic self-efficacy (r = .87, p < .001), and a significant positive correlation between academic self-efficacy and academic achievement (r = .42, p < .001). These findings suggest that self-efficacy is an important factor in academic achievement among college students. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

It's still pretty bad, but not quite as apocalyptic as it appeared when I first posted this last night.  The Detroit Free Press has a lengthy article about Michigan's proposed 2018 individual health insurance market rate filings, and it doesn't look good:  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state's largest insurer, is seeking an average rate increase of 30.9% for its individual policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.  Meanwhile, Molina Healthcare of Michigan, which sells individual policies in Genesee, Ingham, Kent, Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne counties, is seeking an average rate increase of 64.3%.

We needed to get some things for dinner tonight and since we hadn't been to the store in a few days, we decided to go ahead and pick up a few other things we needed.  When we got back home, I put away all the groceries and then spent some time cleaning the house. It felt so good to get everything cleaned up and organized.  Later in the afternoon, my husband and I went for a walk around our neighborhood. It was such a beautiful day out and it was nice to get some fresh air and exercise.  When we got back home, we started working on dinner. We made one of our favorite meals, spaghetti and meatballs. While the sauce was simmering on the stove, we set the table and got everything ready for dinner.  Once dinner was served, we sat down at the table and enjoyed a delicious meal together. We talked about our day and caught up on each other's lives.  After dinner, we watched a movie together and snuggled up on the couch. It was such a cozy and relaxing way to end the night.  As I reflect on today, I feel grateful for the simple

Input:  Bootleg_Series_Volume_1:_The_Quine_Tapes  genre  Rock_music   Output:   It is estimated that approximately 30% of all adults over the age of 65 fall each year. Falls can result in serious injuries such as hip fractures, head trauma, and lacerations. They can also lead to a loss of confidence and self-esteem, which can result in social isolation and depression.  Preventing falls requires a multi-faceted approach. The risk of falling increases with age, so seniors need to take proactive steps to reduce their risk. This includes getting regular exercise, having annual eye exams, taking medications as prescribed, and making home safety modifications.  In this article, we will focus on home safety modifications for seniors to prevent falls.  Remove clutter: Clear walkways and hallways of any clutter, including electrical cords, throw rugs, and furniture.  Install grab bars: Place grab bars in the bathroom near the toilet and in the shower or bathtub. These can provide stability and support when getting in and out of the tub or toilet.  Add lighting: Ensure that all areas of the home are well-lit, especially hallways, stairways, and pathways between rooms.  Install handrails: Add handrails to both sides of stairways and on both sides of any steps leading into or out of the home.  Replace throw rugs with slip-resistant mats: Throw rugs can easily slip and cause falls. Replace them

Input:  Nie_Haisheng  birthPlace  Zaoyang ,  Zaoyang  isPartOf  Hubei   Output:   Q: How can I change the background color of a cell when its value changes? I have a spreadsheet with two columns. The first column is used to input values, and the second column displays the result of a calculation based on the value in the first column. When the value in the first column changes, I want the background color of the cell in the first column to change temporarily (e.g., for 1 second) to indicate that the value has changed.  Is there a way to do this using Google Sheets scripting or another method?  A: You can achieve this by using the onEdit() function. Here is an example code:  function onEdit(e) {    var range = e.range;    if (range.getColumn() == 1 && range.getValue() != range.offset(0, 0).getValue()) { // Check if the edited cell is in column 1 and its value is different from the original value      range.setBackground("#FF0000"); // Set the background color to red for demonstration purposes      Utilities.sleep(1000); // Wait for 1 second      range.setBackground(""); // Reset the background color    }  }  In this example, we check if the edited cell is in column 1 (you can change it to match your needs) and if its value is different from the original value

The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 is that the fabric is a bit thinner than I anticipated. However, I would still make the purchase again as the overall quality of the product is excellent. Answer:  OPTIONS:  - No  -

I want to get the path of the current directory in Kotlin.  In Java, we can use System.getProperty("user.dir") to get the current directory path.  How can I do this in Kotlin?  A: In Kotlin, you can access the system properties using the kotlin.system.properties object.  So, to get the current directory path, you can use:  val currentDir = kotlin.system.properties["user.dir"]  A: The accepted answer is correct, but for Kotlin script files (.kts), you need to add import kotlin.system.* at the top of the file.

Mercedes-Benz on Monday revealed a new concept car previewing its next-generation electric sedans.  Called the Vision EQXX, the concept is said to represent the automaker's most efficient vehicle ever, with a range of more than 620 miles on a single charge. That's nearly double the range of the current long-range leader, the Tesla Model S Plaid, which has a range of 391 miles.  Mercedes said the concept achieves the impressive range through a combination of efficiency improvements in the powertrain, aerodynamics, lightweight materials, and thermal management.  Aerodynamics play a big role in the concept's efficiency. The drag coefficient (Cd) is just 0.17, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient cars ever built. For comparison, the previous record holder was the Volkswagen XL1 plug-in hybrid with a Cd of 0.183.  Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX concept  Lightweight materials also play a big role. The body structure is made from aluminum and high-strength steels,

Title: Disappointing Review: I am a huge fan of fantasy fiction, and have read multitudes of books in the genre. I generally will finish a book even if I am not enjoying it, however this book was so awful that I could not force myself to complete it. The characters are bland and cliche, the "world building" is repetitive and pointless. The writing is extremely juvenile with sentences such as: "Feechie fell into the water with his sword clutched in his hand. He looked at the sword in confusion as raindrops splashed into his eyes." The plot premise is uninteresting, and the twists are predictable. This book was an utter waste of my time and money; there are far better works of fantasy out there.  d

Not only did it arrive several days late, it was cheaply made and did not work properly. We had to take the original motor back because it would not wind the clock sufficiently to get it started. The new motor sort of works. When we wind the clock, it does tick, but it doesn't move forward on its own. The bird still pops out nicely, but it should move around the clock as it ticks. I do not recommend this product at all. Save your money.  Answer:  dissatisfied

An encryption algorithm can use either symmetric or asymmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: one for encryption and one for decryption.  The following sections describe some common encryption algorithms.  DES (Data Encryption Standard)  DES is a symmetric block cipher with a fixed block size of 64 bits and a variable key size of 40, 56, or 64 bits. DES was developed by IBM in the late 1960s and early 1970s and adopted as a standard by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in 1977. In 1998, DES was replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Triple DES (3DES)  Triple DES (3DES) is simply

A: Went here for lunch today with some co-workers. It was my first time there. The food was ok but nothing special. I had the chicken fajita burrito with rice and beans. The burrito itself was pretty good but the rice and beans were very bland. My biggest gripe was the service. Our waitress was friendly enough but took forever to bring us our drinks, take our order, bring our food, and bring our checks. We were there for over an hour and a half and probably only saw our waitress for about 15 minutes of that time. She seemed to be the only one working so I can understand her being busy but we weren't the only table in the place. Probably won't be going back.  Q: negative  A: This place is terrible.  Food is mediocre at best.  Service is always slow.  Waiters don't seem to know what they are doing.  They have never been able to get our order right.  Last time we went, they forgot to put in part of our order.  When we asked about it, they said they would bring it out "right away".  We waited another 15 minutes and finally left without it.  On top of everything else, they charged us for it.  Don't

Chevrolet has been spotted testing a convertible version of its all-new 2015 Corvette Z06 supercar. The car was spotted by our spies near the automaker's Milford Proving Grounds in Michigan.  The new Z06 convertible is expected to follow the coupe into showrooms late this year or early next year. We already know that the car will feature the same 6.2-liter supercharged V-8 engine found in the coupe, which delivers 650 horsepower and 650 pound-feet of torque when equipped with the available performance exhaust system.  DON'T MISS: 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 First Drive  The engine is mated to either a seven-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission, both of which send power to the rear wheels. In the case of the manual, there's also an electronic limited-slip differential (eLSD) for improved traction.  As for the convertible, we can see from these spy shots that it features a folding hardtop similar to the

The music is loud and starts when you place a ball in the tube, so I have to hide the basketball. The balls that come with it are hard for little hands to grip, and they're the size of a child's fist, so they could hit their heads with them. The thing tips over, and isn't very well made at all.

Input:  Piotr_Hallmann  birthPlace  Gdynia,_Poland ,  Piotr_Hallmann  weight  70.308 ,  Gdynia,_Poland  timeZone  Central_European_Time   Output:   The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between leadership styles and organizational commitment among nurses working in selected private hospitals in Ghana. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design. The population for the study consisted of all registered nurses working in three private hospitals in Accra, Ghana. A sample size of 150 respondents was obtained using stratified random sampling technique. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation, and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that transactional leadership style had a significant positive relationship with organizational commitment (r = .426, p < .05). Similarly, transformational leadership style also had a significant positive relationship with organizational commitment (r = .494, p < .05). The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that both transactional and transformational leadership styles significantly predicted organizational commitment among nurses working in private hospitals in Accra, Ghana (R2 = .322, F (2, 147) = 22.272, p < .05). The study concluded that transactional and transformational leadership styles influence organizational commitment among nurses working in private hospitals in Accra, Ghana. It is recommended that hospital administrators should adopt transformational and transactional leadership styles to foster organizational commitment among nurses.

We ordered the crab stuffed shrimp for an appetizer and it was just ok.  For entrees, we ordered the filet mignon and the seafood pasta.  The steak was very tender but lacked flavor.  The seafood pasta was nothing special.  It had a lot of lobster meat but the sauce was bland.  We also ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert.  It was pretty good but again, nothing special.  Overall, the meal was just mediocre.  At the prices they charge, one would expect more.  Q: negative  A: This place sucks. First off, the girl at the front desk is rude.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has launched a new global campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of international commercial arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism for businesses around the world.  The campaign, which will run throughout 2019 under the banner #ArbitrationMatters, aims to highlight the advantages of arbitration over other forms of dispute resolution through a series of initiatives, including events, social media activities, videos, case studies and articles.  ICC Secretary General, John W.H. Denton AO, said: "In today's increasingly complex and interconnected business environment, companies need to know their disputes can be resolved fairly, efficiently and confidentially. Arbitration offers all of this and more. It is a tried and tested method of resolving cross-border disputes, chosen by parties because of its flexibility, neutrality and enforceability."  "This campaign will showcase the many benefits of arbitration and demonstrate why it remains the preferred method of dispute resolution for businesses around the world," Mr Denton added.  As

These measures could include further expulsions of Russian diplomats, travel bans on senior Russian officials, and restrictions on their access to American financial markets.  The news comes at a time when relations between the two countries are already strained due to various issues, including the ongoing conflict in Syria, allegations of Russian meddling in other countries' elections, and the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom.  The proposed sanctions are part of a larger effort by the US government to hold Russia accountable for its actions and deter future interference in democratic processes around the world. They are also intended to send a strong message to other countries that such behavior will not be tolerated.  However, imposing these sanctions could further escalate tensions between the US and Russia and potentially lead to retaliatory measures from Moscow. It remains to be seen how the Kremlin will respond to this latest development and what impact it will have on the broader geopolitical landscape.

The antitrust lawsuit, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Google used anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly in the online display advertising technology market, which allows advertisers to place ads on websites.

Something like this:  <div ng-repeat="item in items">      <input type="text" ng-model="item.firstName" name="firstName">      <input type="text" ng-model="item.lastName" name="lastName">      <input type="text" ng-model="item.age" name="age">  </div>  And in your controller:  $scope.items = [      {          firstName: '',          lastName: '',          age: ''      },      {          firstName: '',          lastName: '',          age: ''      }

It's intriguing to think that there could be infinite possibilities for each moment in our lives. In this short story, I explore the idea of a man who discovers a way to travel between these parallel universes and confronts the consequences of his choices.  Title: The Traveler  Once upon a time, there was a man named Thomas. He was a physicist with a brilliant mind, often lost in thought, contemplating the complexities of the universe. One day, he stumbled upon a theory that changed his life forever. It spoke of a multiverse, where every decision led to a divergence in the course of events. Determined to prove its validity, Thomas spent years researching and experimenting.  Finally, after countless trials, he succeeded in building a device that allowed him to travel between these parallel universes. Overwhelmed with excitement, Thomas cautiously activated the machine. As he closed his eyes, he felt a surge of energy engulf him, and when he opened them again, he found himself in a completely different world.  In this universe, Thomas had chosen a different career path. Instead of being a physicist, he was a successful novelist. Fascinated by this new reality, he interacted with his counterpart, learning about

The vote was 228-206, with 13 Republicans joining Democrats in supporting the measure. The legislation now heads to Biden's desk to be signed into law.

Review: My husband and I weren't sure if our 21-month-old was ready for this potty, but she absolutely loves it! This has been the best purchase we've made in a long time. We found the instructions a little unclear, so it took some trial and error to install the stickers, but in the end it was worth it. Note to manufacturer: provide instructions with more detail and specificity. The only other negative is that the seat could have been made a little

In 2015, for the first time in history, there were more people aged 60 or over (901 million) than children under the age of five (697 million). By 2030, one in every six people will be over 60 years old. This trend has profound implications for health systems, economies and societies.  The number of people aged 60 or over is projected to more than double by 2050, reaching nearly 2.1 billion. At the same time, life expectancy continues to increase globally, reflecting improvements in nutrition, sanitation, housing, health care and living standards.  Ageing populations pose significant challenges for health systems. Non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases – many of which are associated with ageing – are responsible for 7 out of every 10 deaths worldwide. They also account for 4 out of every 5 health expenditures globally.  In addition to the direct costs of treating non-communicable diseases, they impose indirect costs through reduced productivity, disability and informal care. Globally, the total economic cost of non-communicable diseases was estimated at US$ 7 trillion in 2011, equivalent to 12% of global GDP

A: My husband and I went there for lunch today. We were really excited because we had heard good things about this place. When we walked in, the lady at the counter was very nice and greeted us right away. We ordered the chicken fried steak sandwich and the sloppy joe sandwich. The sandwiches came with a pickle and a bag of chips. The food took a long time to come out but when it did, it looked delicious. The chicken fried steak sandwich was just ok. The meat wasn't cooked all the way through and the gravy was bland. The sloppy joe sandwich was much better. The meat was tender and the sauce was flavorful. Overall, the food was just ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The service was friendly but slow. We probably won't go back.  Q: negative  A: This is the second time I have been to this place. The first time it was pretty good. The second time was awful. First off they didn't have my order ready when they said they would. Then when I got home and started eating the food it was terrible. The chow mein tasted like it was boiled noodles with soy sauce dumped on top. The beef and broccoli

Some of them are legitimate, while others are scams. It can be difficult to tell the difference between the two. This article will give you some great tips for making money online without getting scammed.  TIP! Before you can make any online money, you need to determine what your niche will be. Are you good at writing? Market yourself as a content provider.  If you enjoy writing, give InfoBarrel or Squidoo a try. These sites will let you write what you want in a variety of subjects and then share their ad revenue to you. They also both integrate with the huge Amazon affiliate program, too.  TIP! Make a schedule for yourself. Making money continuously online is related to your perseverance in having a discipline to work each and every day.  Be careful to avoid scams. Not every opportunity that you come across is legitimate. Research anything that you are interested in and look for reviews from other users.  TIP! Think about what you want to be worth when you work online. If you intend to work online, how much is an hour of your time worth? If you're willing to work for a small amount, that's all you'll ever get.  Make use of your spare moments wisely. There are things you can do for online income that take very little focus.

Input:  Piotr_Hallmann  height  175.26 ,  Piotr_Hallmann  weight  70.308   Output:   The New York Times  The new book by Mr. Krugman, “End This Depression Now!” (Norton, $26.95), is a collection of his recent columns, along with some new material, organized around the theme of what he sees as the most important economic issue of our time: how can the United States get out of this depression?  Mr. Krugman argues that the country’s leaders have failed to recognize the severity of the problem and have responded with policies that have only made things worse. In particular, he says, they have embraced fiscal austerity at precisely the wrong time, when the economy needs more stimulus, not less.  In an interview, Mr. Krugman said he had written the book because he wanted to reach a broader audience than his regular newspaper readers. He also wanted to expand on some of his arguments, which are necessarily compressed into a few hundred words in his columns.  “I thought it was important to spell out the case for why we’re in a depression, why it’s not just a bad recession,” he said. “It’s hard to make that case in a column.”  Mr. Krugman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2008, has been a leading proponent of the view that the government should run large budget deficits to promote recovery.

Specifically, the study aimed to examine the following: (1) the extent to which teachers use technology in their teaching practices; (2) the factors that affect teachers' use of technology in their teaching practices; and (3) the role of professional development in enhancing teachers' use of technology in their teaching practices. Data were collected through document analysis, interviews, and questionnaires. A total of 75 respondents participated in the study: 15 school principals, 15 district supervisors, and 45 classroom teachers. Findings revealed that teachers in the participating countries used technology in various ways in their teaching practices. However, their use of technology was mostly at the lower levels of the Technology Integration Model developed by Koehler and Mishra (2008). Factors that affected teachers' use of technology in their teaching practices included availability of ICT resources, training and support, pedagogical content knowledge, teacher efficacy, and motivation. Professional development played a significant role in enhancing teachers' use of technology in their teaching practices. Recommendations for future research and practice were provided.

Input:  Ciudad_Ayala  leaderTitle  Governator ,  Ciudad_Ayala  country  Mexico   Output:   There is no such thing as too much storage space. This is especially true when it comes to your kitchen. A well-organized kitchen can make all the difference when it comes to cooking, cleaning, and storing food. In this blog post, we'll share some tips for creating more storage space in your kitchen.  1. Make Use of Vertical Space  One of the easiest ways to create more storage space in your kitchen is to make use of vertical space. Instead of cramming everything onto your countertops or cabinets, consider installing shelves or racks on your walls. You can use these shelves to store dishes, pots, pans, and other items that you use frequently.  2. Install Pull-Out Shelves  Pull-out shelves are another great way to maximize storage space in your kitchen. These shelves can be installed in base cabinets and pantry cupboards, making it easy to access hard-to-reach items without having to bend over or strain your back.  3. Add a Lazy Susan  If you have corner cabinets, consider adding a lazy Susan to make the most of this often-wasted space. A lazy Susan is a rotating shelf that makes it easy to access items stored in the back of the cabinet.  4. Invest in a Pantry  If you have the space, consider adding a pantry to your kitchen. A pantry is a great place to store

By Tibbetts Brooks  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, First Investors Management Company Inc. failed to disclose to some of its mutual fund clients that it was receiving revenue sharing payments from affiliated broker-dealers in connection with the sale of the mutual funds. The SEC alleges that First Investors also failed to disclose that it had entered into fee offset arrangements with the affiliated broker-dealers, which resulted in the clients effectively paying higher advisory fees than they were led to believe.  The SEC's complaint charges First Investors with violating Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and permanent injunctions against future violations of the securities laws.  Tagged:

It's a time when many people set goals and make resolutions for self-improvement. While some focus on physical health, others prioritize mental well-being, financial stability, or personal growth. Regardless of the specific resolution, the common thread is the desire to make positive changes in one's life.  One popular resolution is to adopt a healthier lifestyle. This could involve eating more nutritious foods, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, or reducing alcohol intake. Making these changes can lead to improved physical health, increased energy levels, and a better overall quality of life.  Another common resolution is to prioritize mental well-being. This could mean setting aside time for self-care, practicing mindfulness, seeking professional help, or building a strong support system. Taking care of one's mental health is crucial for maintaining emotional stability and resilience.  Financial stability is another area where many people aim to improve. This could involve creating a budget, saving more money, paying off debt, or investing wisely. By taking control of one's finances, individuals can experience greater peace of mind and opportunities for future growth.  Personal growth is another popular area for self-improvement. This could involve learning a new skill, reading more, volunteering, or pursuing a long-

To commemorate this special occasion, we have put together a list of some of our favorite moments over the past five years.  We started off with nothing but a dream and a goal to create a company that could make a positive impact on the world. Our first office was a small room in my parent's house where we worked tirelessly to develop our first product. It was during this time that we truly learned the meaning of perseverance and dedication.  In 2016, we launched our very first product, the Luma Comfort WiFi Smart Thermostat. Seeing our hard work come to fruition and finally hold our product in our hands for the first time was an incredibly proud moment for us all.  One of the highlights of our journey so far has been seeing our customers share their experiences with our products. Knowing that our products have made a difference in people's lives and helped them save energy and money is what drives us to continue innovating and improving.  In 2018, we expanded our product line with the launch of the Luma Comfort WiFi Smart Plug. This product allowed us to reach even more customers and provide them with the ability to control and monitor their home's energy usage.  In 2020, we introduced our latest product, the Luma Comfort WiFi Smart Light Switch.

Input:  Bedford_Aerodrome  operatingOrganisation  MotorSport_Vision ,  Bedford_Aerodrome  location  Thurleigh ,  Bedford_Aerodrome  icaoLocationIdentifier  EGBF   Output:   Q: how to use "if" statement with "for" loop in python? I am trying to write a program that calculates the sum of even numbers between 1-100 using for loop and if statement.  Here is my code:  sum = 0  for i in range(1, 101):      if i % 2 == 0:          sum += i  print(sum)  This code works fine, but I want to improve it by adding an if statement inside the for loop. Like this:  sum = 0  for i in range(1, 101):      if i % 2 == 0:          sum += i          if sum > 100:              break  print(sum)  However, when I run this code, it doesn't give me the expected result (4950). Instead, it gives me the sum of all the numbers between 1-100, not just the even numbers.  Can someone explain why this happens and suggest a way to fix it?  A: Your inner if statement is checking if the sum is greater than 100, so once the sum reaches 100 or more, the loop will exit. However, since you are still iterating over all the numbers from 1 to 100, the loop will continue to add

I have a table named users with columns id, username, email, password, created_at, updated_at.  I want to select all rows where updated_at is less than 30 days ago.  This is my current query:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE DATE(updated_at) < DATE(DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()))  Is there a more efficient way to write this query?  Note: I'm using MariaDB.  A: The best way to optimize queries is to use indexes.  In your case, you can create an index on the updated_at column.  CREATE INDEX idx_users_updated_at ON users (updated_at);  After creating the index, your query will perform much faster.  You can also rewrite your query as follows:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE updated_at < DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())  Since MySQL/MariaDB automatically converts datetime values to date when used in comparisons.

The Digital Standards for Trade is a free online platform designed to make it easier for SMEs to comply with international trade rules and procedures. It provides access to over 50 internationally recognised standards and guidelines developed by ICC and its global network of national committees.  "Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the global economy," said ICC Secretary General, World Chambers Federation Executive Director and Digital Standards for Trade Steering Committee Chair, John Denton AO. "Yet many SMEs lack the resources and expertise needed to overcome the myriad of challenges they face when trading across borders. This new digital tool will help level the playing field by providing immediate access to the technical know-how required to participate in international trade."  The launch of the Digital Standards for Trade coincides with the start of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Inland Transport Committee's Working Party on Customs Questions (WP.17) meeting in Geneva,

It turned out really well. The chicken was tender and very flavorful. This is definitely a keeper.  In a large zip-top plastic bag, combine the soy sauce, sherry, brown sugar, garlic, gingerroot, and red pepper flakes. Add chicken; seal bag and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  Drain and discard marinade. In a large nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray, stir-fry chicken in batches over medium heat until no longer pink. Remove and keep warm.

Academic journal article Journal of Marriage and Family  The Effects of Paternal Incarceration on Children's Educational Attainment  By Western, Bruce; Knoester, Caroline  Incarceration rates in the United States have risen dramatically over the past several decades, making the United States the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world (Western & Pettit, 2004). The majority of those incarcerated are fathers, and their imprisonment often disrupts family life for their children (Western & Pettit, 2004). Although research has examined the short-term effects of paternal incarceration on children's well-being (e.g., Brooks-Gunn, McLanahan, & Garfinkel, 1997; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003), less is known about the long-term consequences of paternal incarceration for children's educational attainment.

It's something we've been hearing more and more over the past few years, but now it's no longer just a trend; it's a reality. More and more companies are embracing remote work, flexible schedules, and freelancing as part of their business strategy. This shift is driven by several factors, including advancements in technology, changing demographics, and evolving employee expectations. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind this shift and discuss how businesses can successfully implement flexible work arrangements to reap the benefits.  Advancements in technology have made it easier than ever for employees to work remotely. With tools like video conferencing, instant messaging, and cloud-based collaboration platforms, teams can communicate and collaborate effectively even when they're not in the same physical location. This has opened up new opportunities for companies to hire talent from anywhere in the world, rather than being limited to a specific geographic area.  Changing demographics also play a role in the shift towards flexible work. As millennials become the largest generation in the workforce, their expectations around

How can I create a website for my business?  By: Chris Hogan - Updated: 20 Dec 2012 | *Discuss  The internet is one of the most powerful marketing tools available to businesses today. Whether your business is small or large, local or national, having a website is essential if you want to reach out to potential customers. Creating a website for your business doesn't have to be difficult or expensive. In fact, there are several ways you can do it yourself with little or no technical knowledge required.  Choose a Domain Name  The first step in creating a website for your business is choosing a domain name. This is the address people will type into their web browser to visit your site. Your domain name should be easy to remember, short and ideally related to your business. For example, if your business is called 'John's Plumbing', a good domain name might be johnsplumbing.com.  To register a domain name, you'll need to find a domain registrar. There are many reputable registrars to choose from, including GoDaddy, 123-reg and Network Solutions. The cost of registering a domain name varies depending on the registrar and the length of time you want to register it for. Prices typically start at around £5 per year.

What is the Difference Between Acupuncture and Acupressure?  Acupuncture and acupressure are both ancient healing practices that originated in China over 2,000 years ago. Both therapies are based on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and aim to restore balance and harmony to the body by stimulating specific points along the body's energy pathways, known as meridians. However, there are some key differences between these two modalities.  Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin, sterile needles into specific acupuncture points along the body's meridians. The needles are typically left in place for 15-30 minutes, during which time they may be gently manipulated to enhance their therapeutic effect. Acupuncture is often used to treat a wide range of conditions, including pain, stress, anxiety, insomnia, digestive issues, and more.  Acupressure, on the other hand, involves applying pressure to acupuncture points using the fingers, thumbs, or sometimes special tools. This pressure can be applied for several minutes to stimulate the point and promote healing. Acupressure can be self-administered or performed by a trained practitioner. It is often used to

As they dig deeper, they find out that the settlers harbored a dark secret - they had committed heinous acts against their own community, resulting in the deaths of innocent men, women, and children.  The duo soon realizes that the unsettled spirits of the victims have returned to seek justice for their brutal murders. They must race against time to solve the centuries-old mystery and put the restless souls to rest before more chaos ensues.

In your Gruntfile.js add something like this:  module.exports = function(grunt) {      grunt.initConfig({          ...          serve: {              options: {                  livereload: true,                  open: false,                  debugInfo: true              },              dev: {                  options: {                      open: 'http://localhost:9000'                  }              }          },          openbrowser: {              target: {                  options: {                      url: 'http://localhost:9000'                  }              }          },          watch: {              options: {                  livereload: true              },              files: [

I am trying to create a figure with four subplots arranged in a 2x2 grid. However, I want the bottom-right subplot to be at the top-left, and the top-left subplot to be at the bottom-right. Is there a way to do this in matplotlib?  Here is my current code:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  axs[0, 0].plot(range(10))  axs[0, 1].plot(range(10))  axs[1, 0].plot(range(10))  axs[1, 1].plot(range(10))  plt.show()  This produces a figure with the subplots arranged in the default order (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). How can I switch the positions of the top-left and bottom-right subplots?  A: One way to do this is to use the rearrange_axes function from the seaborn library. This function allows you to rearrange the subplots after they have been created.  First, install seaborn if you haven't already

By John Manganaro  The high court's decision effectively leaves intact the PTE 84-24, which allows financial services firms to receive compensation for providing investment advice to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) without running afoul of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code's prohibited transaction rules.  The DOL first issued PTE 84-24 in 1984 to address concerns that certain transactions between plan fiduciaries and service providers could result in conflicts of interest. Since its initial issuance, the PTE has been amended several times, most recently in 2005.  In June 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the validity of PTE 84-24, rejecting arguments made by the

This popular saying reminds us not to make assumptions about someone or something based solely on their appearance. However, when it comes to your website, first impressions are everything.  Your website is often the first interaction potential customers have with your brand. It's essential to make a good first impression because if visitors don't like what they see, they'll leave and never return. Here are some tips to improve your website's visual appeal and keep visitors engaged.  1. Use High-Quality Visuals  High-quality visuals, such as images and videos, are crucial for creating an engaging and visually appealing website. These elements break up large blocks of text, making it easier for visitors to navigate and understand the content. In addition, high-quality visuals communicate your brand's personality and values, helping to establish an emotional connection with your audience.  2. Choose the Right Color Scheme  Color plays a significant role in setting the mood and tone of your website. Choosing the right color scheme can enhance the overall visual appeal and create a cohesive design. Consider your brand's identity and target audience when selecting colors. For example, cooler colors like blue and green tend to evoke feelings of calmness and trust, while warmer colors like red and orange convey energy and excitement.  3. Maint

I have written a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. However, when I try to run the function with multiple inputs, it only returns the result for the last input. How can I modify the function so that it returns the result for each input separately?  Here is my code:  def sum_even(numbers):      total = 0      for num in numbers:          if num % 2 == 0:              total += num      return total  # First input  numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  result1 = sum_even(numbers1)  print(result1)  # Second input  numbers2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  result2 = sum_even(numbers2)  print(result2)  The output I get is:  10  45  But what I want is:  6  45  A: This happens because you are using the same variable total for calculating the sum of both lists.  You can fix this by moving the declaration of total inside the function:  def sum_even(numbers):      total = 0      for num in

"This declaration will help us remove any remaining barriers to expanding testing and vaccination efforts, and ensure we have the resources necessary to combat the spread of monkeypox in our city," Adams said.  As of Tuesday, there were 1,402 confirmed cases of monkeypox in New York City, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

Isani Cayetano, Reporting  The People's United Party today filed an application for special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal over the constitutionality of the Referendum Act. The legislation, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday, provides for the holding of a national referendum on the issue of whether Belize should seek to take its territorial dispute with Guatemala to the International Court of Justice. The P.U.P. argues that the act contravenes several sections of the constitution, including the right to vote, freedom of expression and protection against discrimination.  John Saldivar  Hon.

Researchers at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), which included 36,344 adults aged 18 years and older interviewed between 2001-2002 and 2004-2005.  They found that women who reported using marijuana during pregnancy were 37 percent more likely to have children with ADHD symptoms compared to women who did not use marijuana during pregnancy. The association was stronger among women who used marijuana heavily during pregnancy.  "We know that prenatal exposure to tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, and opioids is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes," said Dr. Katherine Manthey, Ph.D., M.P.H., lead author of the study.  "Our study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that prenatal marijuana exposure is also associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes."

We were part of consortia such as SCONUL and JISC Collections, we collaborated with other institutions through projects such as COUNTER, LIBER and RLUK, and we participated in initiatives such as the UK Web Archive and Europeana.  The last few years have seen NUL continue to develop its national and international collaborations. For example, we recently became a founding member of the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) for Social Sciences and Humanities (SHARE), and we are actively involved in the development of the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC).  These collaborations benefit us in many ways. They enable us to share resources and expertise, strengthen our position in negotiations with publishers and suppliers, and increase our influence in shaping policy. They also allow us to learn from others and gain new perspectives.  Collaboration is fundamental to what we do. It helps us to achieve more together than we could alone.  At the same time, however, there are pressures on libraries to differentiate themselves in order to stand out in a crowded marketplace. These pressures can make collaboration more difficult.  So how do we balance the need to collaborate with the need

We immediately told the cashier and asked if there was a lost and found. The cashier said no, but she would ask the manager. The manager came over and also said there was no lost and found. They both suggested we go around and ask each employee if they had seen it. We did that and no one had seen it. While we were looking for it, several customers came in and bought items. As we were leaving, we mentioned to the cashier that we were leaving and thanked her for her help. She then said, "Oh, by the way, someone just turned in a wallet." It was my wife's wallet.

I was disappointed that you could not easily see what was playing on the screen from a distance when it was docked. This is a major issue for us since it is in the kitchen and I often want to see what's playing while I'm preparing dinner, etc. If you have the iPod or iPhone attached separately, you can see it, but then you have to have an extra cord hanging down and it takes up another plug on your surge protector. Not the best solution for use with an iPod. Answer:  A: No  Q: Is this product review positive? Title: Waste of time and money Review: As someone who has read many of Ms. Conway's other titles, I was extremely disappointed in this book. It wanders all over the place, repeating the same (uninteresting) information over and over again. There isn't a real story in this book, just a collection of loosely related vignettes.

It would be located in a peaceful, secluded area surrounded by nature, but still easily accessible for artists and musicians to come record their music.  My dream studio would be a multi room setup in a converted barn somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

As for gear, I'd want a nice selection of mics, preamps, compressors, EQs, converters, monitors, etc. But mostly, I'd want a collection of classic analog synths, drum machines, samplers, and effects units.

Well, of course, he loves to jump on the bed and couches to hang out with us. I got this so he could get up to the couches without jumping. At first he was too scared to try it, but once he saw his sister use it, he gave it a shot. It's so adorable to see him use it; he's 20lbs with big paws, but he figures it out every time. It's sturdy and perfect. He can even figure out to reverse if he goes up and realizes "uh oh, wrong window!" Definitely recommended. Answer:  A: Positive

Input:  Nie_Haisheng  nationality  People's_Republic_of_China ,  Nie_Haisheng  occupation  Fighter_pilot   Output:   Question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I bought this book because I was interested in learning more about how the mind works, one of the topics listed on the back cover. In the section about intelligence, the author says that the human mind "sorts outnumerous inputs to select those that appear to make most coherent sense as a unified first explanation of reality", which sounds plausible until you realize that this is exactly what scientific theories do. The author claims that the book provides "a unified conceptual framework for understanding our experiences and the world around us", but nowhere does he provide any such thing. That said, the book is full of interesting tidbits about how the mind perceives the world, along with some errors (genes are not stored in the nucleus of the cell - they are DNA, and DNA is found in the nucleus), and over-simplifications and/or omissions that undermine many of the arguments he presents. I'm sorry I spent the money on this book. Too bad you can't return books after you've actually read them.

I have a script that checks how many times a specific word appears in a column in a csv file. The problem is that the file is quite large and the script takes too long to run. Is there a way to make it more efficient?  import csv  from collections import Counter  with open('file.csv', newline='') as csvfile:      reader = csv.reader(csvfile)      next(reader)      data = list(reader)  word = 'specific_word'  count = 0  for row in data:      if word in row[0]:          count += 1  print(count)  A: This can be made faster by using pandas library. It has a built-in function called value_counts() that counts the number of occurrences of each unique value in a Series or DataFrame.  First, install pandas using pip:  pip install pandas  Then, modify your code as follows:  import pandas as pd  df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')  count = df[df.iloc[:, 0].str.contains(word)].shape[0]  print(count)  Here, iloc[:, 0] selects the first column of the DataFrame, str.

Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, harming marine life and polluting our environment. In response to this crisis, there has been a growing demand for eco-friendly alternatives to traditional plastic packaging. Here are some sustainable options that are gaining popularity:  1. Paper: Paper is a versatile and biodegradable material that can be used for various types of packaging. It can be sourced from sustainably managed forests and is easily recyclable. Paper packaging is commonly used for products such as food, cosmetics, and household items.  2. Bamboo: Bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource that can be used to create strong and durable packaging materials. It is biodegradable and compostable, making it an excellent alternative to single-use plastics. Bamboo packaging is often used for food, cosmetics, and personal care products.  3. Bioplastics: Bioplastics are made from renewable sources such as cornstarch, sugarcane, and other plant-based materials. They offer many of the same benefits as traditional plastics, but they are biodegradable and compostable. Biop

In users table there is a field named "user_id" and in user_details table there is a field named "user_id".  Now I want to retrieve data from user_details table where user_id = $this->Session->read('Auth.User.id')  How can I do this?  A: In your User model, you need to define hasOne relation with UserDetails model.  class User extends AppModel {      public $hasOne = array(          'UserDetails' => array(              'className' => 'UserDetails',              'foreignKey' => 'user_id',              'dependent' => false          )      );  }  Then in your controller, you can use containable behavior to load related data.  $this->User->find('all', array(      'contain' => array(          'UserDetails'      )  ));  This will load all Users along with their related UserDetails.  You can also specify condition for UserDetails using conditions key.  $this->User->find('all', array(      'contain' => array(          'UserDetails' => array(              'conditions' => array(                  'UserDetails

It rattled and I could hear something moving inside the box when I got it. The person I sent it to opened it before I even got the replacement and the game piece was broken, we couldn't use it at all. I returned it and asked for a replacement, the next one I got was printed wrong, the colors bled into each other and you couldn't tell which colors were which. It was unplayable as well so I returned ALL of them. Ten dollars is not a lot but I'd expect a better quality game than this.  The answer is:  dissatisfied

By John Manganaro  A federal district court has denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit alleging fiduciary breaches under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) against certain fiduciaries of the General Motors Salaried Retirement Plan (GM Plan).  The complaint was originally filed in September 2018 by two participants in the GM Plan, represented by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP. The plaintiffs allege the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by including high-cost investment options in the plan lineup and failing to prudently monitor the fees and expenses associated with the plan's investment options.  In response, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Specifically, the defendants argued the plaint

Texas-based tuner Hennessey Performance Engineering is working on a new hypercar dubbed the Venom F5. The car was first teased last year but now we have some more details thanks to a post on the company's Facebook page.  According to the post, the Venom F5 will feature a twin-turbocharged V-8 engine delivering over 1,600 horsepower. That's enough to propel the car to a top speed in excess of 300 mph, making it the fastest production car in the world.  The current record holder is the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which has a top speed of 268 mph. However, the upcoming Bugatti Chiron is expected to break the 300-mph barrier when it arrives in 2016.  Hennessey says the Venom F5 will come with a carbon fiber monocoque chassis and body, active aerodynamics, and pushrod-actuated Ohlins suspension.

This book has been getting a lot of buzz lately, and for good reason. It's a quick read, but packs a powerful punch.  The premise of the book is that there is a right way and a wrong way to organize your home. Most people approach organization with the mentality of "less is more," which means they try to get rid of as many things as possible. In contrast, Kondo suggests that you keep everything that "sparks joy" within you, and only discard items that do not.  Kondo argues that if you follow her method, you will never have to tidy again. She explains that most people don't really enjoy organizing their homes, so they put it off until it gets out of control, and then they spend hours trying to fix it all at once. By following her method, however, you will actually enjoy the process of sorting through your belongings, because you will be surrounded by things that make you happy.  One of the biggest takeaways from this book for me was the idea of thanking each item before deciding whether or not to keep it. When you thank something for the role it played in your life, it becomes much easier to let go of it if it no longer sparks joy.  For example,

A: I really wanted to like this place because it is conveniently located near my house, but after two visits I don't think I will be going back. The first time I went was for lunch and ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The meat was dry and the bun was stale. The fries were good though. The second time I went was for happy hour and ordered the pretzel appetizer. The pretzel itself was good, but the cheese sauce was bland. The service was also slow both times.  Q: negative  A: We came here for dinner with a group of friends last night. Our server was very friendly and did his best to accommodate our large group. However, the food was terrible. It tasted like it was all frozen and reheated. The only thing that was decent was the calamari. The rest of the food was subpar at best. The tiramisu dessert was also pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Problem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) review?  Answer: This place is amazing! They have great sandwiches, soups, and salads. The people who work there are super nice and they make everything fresh right in front of you

Input:  Darlington  region  North_East_England   Output:   This week we will be looking at the work of American artist Charles White (1918-1979). White was born in Chicago and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and later at the Art Students League in New York City. He is considered one of the most important African-American artists of the 20th century.  White's art is known for its powerful social commentary, focusing on issues such as racism, poverty, and segregation. He often depicted African-American subjects, portraying them with dignity and strength. Many of his works were inspired by historical events and figures, as well as by everyday life in African-American communities.  White worked in various mediums, including drawing, painting, printmaking, and sculpture. His style can be described as a combination of realism and modernism, with strong influences from African and African-American art traditions.  Throughout his career, White received numerous awards and honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, and his works are held in many prestigious collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Charles White played a significant role in promoting social justice and raising awareness about the African-American experience through his powerful and evocative artwork.

The generated questions should be open-ended and not easily answerable with a single word or a phrase.  Passage: In a village, there are 200 houses. Each house has an average of 3 people living in it. How many people live in total in the village?  In the village, if there are 200 houses and each house has an average of 3 people living in it, to find the total number of people living in the village, we can multiply the total number of houses by the average number of people per house.  So, the calculation would be 200 houses * 3 people/house.  Therefore, there are 600 people living in total in the village (200 houses * 3 people/house = 600 people).The answer is: 600

I am new to web development and I am trying to set up a local web server to test my work before pushing it to production. I have installed XAMPP on my windows machine but when I try to access http://localhost/ in my browser, it says "This site can't be reached". What am I doing wrong?  A: Make sure your XAMPP control panel is running and all the services (Apache, MySQL, etc.) are started. Then try again.  Also, make sure you don't have any firewalls blocking the port 80 (http) or 443 (https).  Finally, check if another application is already using port 80. You can do this by running the command netstat -an | findstr :80 in the command prompt. If there is something listening on port 80, you will need to either stop that application or change the port used by XAMPP.  To change the port used by Apache in XAMPP, open the file xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf and search for the line Listen 80. Replace 80 with the port you want to use (e.g. Listen 8080). Then save the file and restart the Apache service via the XAMPP control panel.

Review: I really enjoyed this book. It held my interest from the first page to the last. Loved the characters and the conflict. Can't wait for more books in the series. Answer:  A: Positive  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Very Good Review: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, but, it has one major flaw. The love between Antony and Cleopatra seems fake and is not convincing at all. The main problem is that in all of the scenes showing their love, they barely speak to each other, making their love quite unbelievable. In one scene, when Cleopatra is about to meet Antony for the first time since their separation, she says she is nervous, but then they meet and there is no sign that they truly miss each other. These problems aside, the movie does show the fall of Antony and the hold Cleopatra had over him very well.

This project is part of DHS S&T's Cybersecurity for Small Business (CSB) program, which focuses on increasing the cyber resilience of small businesses through education, outreach, and technology development.  "Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy," said William N. Bryan, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. "But they often lack the resources to adequately protect themselves against cyber threats. This project will help level the playing field by providing them with affordable, easy-to-use cybersecurity tools."  The SEI team will develop two cybersecurity tools for small businesses: a vulnerability scanner and a security incident response tool. The vulnerability scanner will assess the cybersecurity posture of a small business's IT systems and recommend cost-effective remediation measures. The security incident response tool will help small businesses detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Both tools will be designed to be user-friendly and cost-effective

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: "In line with all relevant guidance and with the health and wellbeing of those involved foremost in our thoughts, it has been decided that this year The Queen's pre-Christmas luncheon will not take place."  It comes after Boris Johnson urged people to be cautious over the festive period amid fears over the spread of the Omicron variant.

The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress in its attempt to become the dominant handheld console of the 16-bit era, but it was not as successful as its rival, the Game Boy, and it struggled to maintain exclusivity due to the increasing trend of multiplatform games. By late 1992, the Game Gear's lack of third-party software support effectively made it obsolete, and in North America Sega stopped producing new titles for the system in 1993. In Japan, however, first-party releases continued until 1997, with third-party titles coming as late as 1999.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world.

He'll report to Triple-A Las Vegas.  Matsuzaka, 36, hasn't pitched in the Majors since 2014, when he appeared in six games for the Indians. Last year, he spent time with the Yokohama BayStars in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league, where he posted a 4.22 ERA with 5.8 K/9 and 2.7 BB/9 in 12 starts.  The Mets will be the fifth Major League organization for Matsuzaka, who was famously posted by the Seibu Lions after the 2006 season. He then signed a six-year, $52MM contract with the Red Sox, which included a $51.1MM posting fee. Matsuzaka went on to spend seven seasons in Boston, during which time he made two All-Star teams and helped the Red Sox win the 2007 World Series. In 2012, he was traded to the Indians, for whom he pitched parts of two seasons before returning to Japan.  It's unclear whether Matsuzaka could ever make it back to

Solve -47*d + 8 = -45*d for d.  To solve the equation -47*d + 8 = -45*d for d, follow these steps:  Step 1: Isolate the variable 'd' by moving all terms containing 'd' to one side of the equation and constants to the other side.  To do this, add 47*d to both sides of the equation:  -47*d + 47*d + 8 = -45*d + 47*d  This simplifies to:  8 = 2*d  Step 2: Solve for 'd' by isolating it.  To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 2:  8 / 2 = 2*d / 2  This simplifies to:  4 = d  So, the solution to the equation is d = 4.

Input:  Nurhan_Atasoy  citizenship  Turkey   Output:   I have always been passionate about helping people improve their health and well-being through nutrition. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Nutritional Sciences from the University of Toronto, I went on to pursue a Master of Science in Human Nutrition from the University of Guelph. During my time at Guelph, I focused my research on the impact of dietary patterns on cardiometabolic risk factors.  In addition to my formal education, I have also completed certifications in Sports Nutrition and Plant-Based Nutrition. I am a member of Dietitians of Canada and the College of Dietitians of Ontario.  As a Registered Dietitian, I work with individuals to develop personalized nutrition plans that fit their lifestyle, food preferences, and cultural background. I believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to nutrition, and each person's needs are unique. My goal is to empower individuals with knowledge and practical strategies to make sustainable changes towards optimal health.  In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new plant-based recipes, practicing yoga, and spending time outdoors with my family and friends.

Input:  Morelos  areaTotal  4879.0   Output:   We had our first snow of the year last night. It wasn't much, just enough to cover the ground for a few hours, but it was enough to make me happy. Snow always makes me happy. I love the way it looks, the way it feels, the way it sounds when it crunches underfoot. I love the way it transforms the world into a sparkling wonderland.  This is the first winter we'll spend in our new house, and I can't wait to see how it looks all covered in snow. Our backyard slopes gently downward, so I imagine making snowmen and having snowball fights will be a lot of fun.  It's still early in the season, so there's no telling how much snow we'll get this winter. But regardless of how much falls, I know I'll enjoy every moment of it. There's just something magical about snow that brings out the child in all of us. So bring on the snow, I'm ready to embrace the winter wonderland.

Not this one. I read the directions, waited five minutes, and put it into operation. It made a huge mess and a lot of noise for nothing. It simply will not grind coffee. It makes an awful racket as the bean container spins, but the burrs never touch. I thought maybe it needed to be lubricated, so I followed the instruction to use corn oil to lubricate "every two weeks." I did that, but to no avail. The burrs still don't meet. Big disappointment. Answer:  A: Negative  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Good idea, poor execution Review: These look great, but the functionality is sacrificed for the looks.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable urban mobility by encouraging people to change their travel habits and use cleaner and healthier modes of transport such as walking, cycling or public transport.  In Monaco, the Department of Urban Planning, Mobility and Sustainable Development has organised various events throughout the week to raise awareness among residents and visitors about the importance of sharing public spaces with pedestrians.  On Monday, 17th September, a stand was set up at the Condamine Market to present the City's initiatives for sustainable mobility, including the new bike-sharing service, the extension of the Portier car park, the development of the bus network and the implementation of parking meters.  On Wednesday, 19th September, a seminar was held at the Grimaldi Forum on the subject of "Walkability", attended by local authorities, experts and professionals in the fields of urban planning and mobility.

By P&I Staff  (Bloomberg) — The board of the $445 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) voted unanimously to reject a shareholder proposal filed by Arjuna Capital calling on BlackRock to disclose how it is managing climate-related financial risks across its investment portfolios.  In a statement, CalPERS said it believes the proposal is unnecessary because BlackRock has already adopted many of the requested measures.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink announced last month that the asset manager will make sustainability integral to its investment process and product offerings. As part of the changes, BlackRock will exit investments in companies that generate more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production.  "We believe BlackRock's recent announcement demonstrates that they understand the importance of addressing climate risk," said Rob Feckner

She is accused of a crime she did not commit and is sentenced to death. Claude Frollo, the heartless archdeacon, wants to protect her from execution and quarantines her in Notre Dame. Phoebus, Esmeralda's lover, promises to save her but betrays her to Frollo. Quasimodo rescues Esmeralda from the gallows and runs away with her. She eventually falls in love with Quasimodo. My opinion: Although the story was interesting, it seemed unrealistic that Esmeralda would come to love Quasimodo, a severely deformed man, when she had everything to live for.

Input:  Turkey  percentageOfAreaWater  1.3   Output:   Q: How can I make this code faster? I have a piece of code that is slowing down my program significantly. It calculates the similarity between two strings using Levenshtein distance. The problem is that I need to calculate the similarity for every string in a list against every other string in the list. Here is the code:  from scipy.spatial.distance import levenshtein  def calc_similarity(strings: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:      result = []      for i in range(len(strings)):          row = []          for j in range(len(strings)):              if i == j:                  row.append(1)              else:                  row.append(levenshtein(strings[i], strings[j]))          result.append(row)      return result  This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents the similarity between the string at the same index in the input list and all other strings in the list.  For example, if the input list is ['cat', 'cats', 'dog'], the output will be:  [[0, 1, 3],   [1, 0, 2],   [3, 2, 0]]  The

It's very true to the book, has cute humor for kids and adults, and has a very sweet storyline. Answer:  Answer: Yes  Question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I purchased this item because it was advertised as self-cleaning and had an air filter with replaceable filters. It also appears to be a Honeywell product. However, it turns out the air filter is not replaceable (it is a wick inside the water reservoir).

We mostly use the fine grate, but the coarse grate works great for shredding cheese. The only complaint (and it is not much of one) is that it does not hold a lot at one time, but the size makes up for that shortcoming as it fits well in most dishes. A solid product at a good price.  Answer:  satisfied

Positive Effects:  1. Connectivity: Social media allows us to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away. We can easily keep in touch through messaging, video calls, and sharing updates.  2. Community Building: Online communities provide a sense of belonging for individuals who may feel isolated or misunderstood in their offline lives. These communities offer support, encouragement, and friendship.  3. Access to Information: Social media platforms serve as a valuable source of news and information. They enable us to stay informed about current events and issues that matter to us.  4. Self-Expression: Social media provides a platform for self-expression.

We didn't have the luxury of having everything at our fingertips. We had to go out and explore the world around us. We had to use our imaginations and create our own adventures.  But now, everything has changed. The world is at our fingertips, and we don't have to leave the comfort of our homes to explore. We can connect with people from all over the world through social media, without ever having to step outside.  While technology has brought us many conveniences, it has also taken something away from us. It has taken away our sense of adventure, our ability to imagine, and our desire to explore the physical world around us.  We spend hours scrolling through our phones, mindlessly consuming content, instead of going out and creating our own experiences. We rely on technology to entertain us, instead of finding ways to entertain ourselves.  It's time to rediscover the joy of exploration. To put down our phones, step outside, and immerse ourselves in the world around us. To use our imaginations and create our own adventures.  Technology will always be a part of our lives, but it shouldn't define it. Let's strike a balance between the virtual and the physical world, and embrace the thrill of real-life exploration once again.

I am trying to make my discord bot send a message every time a user says a specific word. For example, if someone says "hello", the bot will respond with "Hello back at you!"  Here is what I have tried so far:  import discord  from discord.ext import commands  intents = discord.Intents.default()  intents.message_content = True  bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)  @bot.event  async def on_message(message):      if message.content.lower() == "hello":          await message.channel.send("Hello back at you!")  bot.run('token')  However, this doesn't seem to be working. Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong and how to fix it?  A: Your code should work fine, but there are some things to check:  *  *Make sure you replaced 'token' with your bot's actual token.  *Make sure your bot has the INTENTS.MESSAGE_CONTENT intent enabled.  *Make sure your bot is in the channel where you are testing it.  *Make sure you are using the command prefix (!) when sending the message

Input:  Pontiac_Rageous  assembly  Michigan ,  Pontiac_Rageous  bodyStyle  Coupe   Output:   Question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I have been using this product for over a year now and am very pleased with the results. For years my hair has been thinning(not enough to shave it but enough to be noticeable). After about 3 months of using Nioxin, the thinning process seemed to stop. My hair is healthy and grows fairly fast. Some people might say that Nioxin "caused" my hair to stop thinning but I don't believe it. I think what happened was I hadn't found a shampoo that didn't further damage my hair until I started using Nioxin. So to those considering trying Nioxin, understand that it won't help if you continue to damage your hair(hot curlers, tight rubber bands, peroxide/dye, etc.). Also, understand that a little bit goes a long way. Even with daily use, one bottle lasts me over 6 months. Answer:  OPTIONS:  - No  - Yes  Answer: Yes  Question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: This book is a collection of articles written by various authors at different times for the Strategic Investment publication. Most of the material is still relevant and the biographies of each author is interesting in and of itself. Sort of a nice

By John Manganaro  The New York City Council has passed Intro 436-A, a bill that will require private-sector employers with at least 10 employees to automatically enroll workers in individual retirement accounts (IRAs) unless they already offer a retirement plan.  According to a press release from the office of New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, the new law is designed to address the fact that "nearly half of all working New Yorkers have no access to a retirement savings plan through their employer."  "This legislation will level the playing field by ensuring that every hardworking New Yorker has the opportunity to save for their retirement," Mark-Viverito says. "For too long, our city's middle class and working families have been left out of the retirement security system, which is why we must take action now to make sure everyone has the tools they need to retire with dignity."  Under the terms of Intro 436-A, employers will be required

Input:  1147_Stavropolis  apoapsis  418476000000.0 ,  1147_Stavropolis  discoverer  Grigory_Neujmin   Output:   Q: How can I get the first day of current week in SQL Server? I want to get the first day of the current week in SQL Server.  How can I do this?  A: The simplest way is to use DATEADD() with DATEPART():  SELECT DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, GETDATE()) % 7, 0)  This returns the first day of the current week. It calculates the difference between the current date and the first day of the week (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, etc.) using DATEDIFF(), then takes the remainder of that result when divided by 7. Finally, it subtracts that remainder from the first day of the week.  If you want the first day of the week to be Monday instead of Sunday, replace 0 with 1 in the above expression.  A: In SQL Server 2012+ you can use EOMONTH() and DATEFROMPARTS():  SELECT DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(GETDATE()), EOMONTH(GETDATE(), 0) - DATEPART(WEEKDAY, GETDATE()) + 1, 1)  A: SELECT DATEADD(day, DATEDIFF(day, 0, GETDATE()) % 7,

One CAI program used traditional drill and practice exercises, while the other used problem-solving activities. A total of 106 sixth grade students from two junior high schools participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: Traditional Drill and Practice CAI, Problem-Solving CAI, Traditional Drill and Practice Non-CAI, and Problem-Solving Non-CAI. Each group received 20 forty-five minute sessions of instruction over a ten week period. Students completed pretest and posttest measures of attitudes toward mathematics and achievement in mathematics. Results indicated that there were no significant differences between the four groups on either the pretest or posttest measures of attitudes toward mathematics. In addition, there were no significant differences between the four groups on the pretest measure of achievement in mathematics. On the posttest measure of achievement in mathematics, results indicated that students in the Traditional Drill and Practice CAI group had significantly higher scores than students in the Traditional Drill and Practice Non-CAI group. There were no significant differences between the Problem-Solving CAI group and the Traditional Drill and Practice Non-CAI group or between the Problem-Solving CAI

Vance, Russell Crowe  Rating: [4/5]  The cinematic universe concept has become a bit overused at this point, but when done right, it can create something special. For Universal Studios, they decided to reboot their classic monster movies into a shared universe, starting with The Mummy. It brings back one of the most recognizable monsters from their library and attempts to ground it in a contemporary action-adventure film. While it doesn't necessarily hit all the marks, it does enough to establish a solid foundation for what could come next.  Nick Morton (Tom Cruise) works as a soldier of fortune alongside his partner Chris Vail (Jake Johnson). They stumble upon an ancient tomb in Iraq containing Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), who was mummified thousands of years ago for attempting to summon Set, the god of chaos. Nick unwittingly releases her and sets off a chain of events that forces him to team up with Dr. Jennifer Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) and Prodigium, an organization dedicated

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Good Review: This book is a good look into the life of an Afghan family that fled to the US when the Taliban took over. It's interesting to hear about day to day life in Afghanistan before it was taken over by terrorists. It's also interesting to hear how different their culture is from ours (as one can imagine). There are times when this book is a little hard to follow, but only because you have to keep in mind that you are reading about another culture, not just another person's life. Understanding that makes her stories easier to follow.  Answer:  satisfied

The research team found that overexpression of the gene, called LRIG3, was associated with more aggressive forms of prostate cancer, increased metastasis and decreased patient survival.  "LRIG3 is highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer, which accounts for approximately 90 percent of advanced prostate cancers," said senior author Chandra Sekhar Pemmaraju, Ph.D., professor of Genomic Medicine and member of the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MD Anderson. "Our findings suggest that LRIG3 could serve as a potential therapeutic target for this deadly disease."  Pemmaraju and his colleagues analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)—a comprehensive catalog of genomic abnormalities across 33 different cancer types—and found that LRIG3 expression was significantly higher in prostate tumors compared to normal prostate tissues. They also found that high levels of LRIG3 were associated with poorer overall survival rates in patients with prostate cancer.  To further investigate

Input:  Take_It_Off!  producer  Wharton_Tiers   Output:   This week we are highlighting one of our most popular products, the Bamboo Toothbrush. The Bamboo Toothbrush is made from 100% biodegradable and sustainable materials. The handle is made from Moso Bamboo, which is naturally antibacterial and antimicrobial. The bristles are made from Nylon-6, which is completely recyclable through TerraCycle's Oral Care Recycling Program.  The average person uses approximately 350 toothbrushes in their lifetime. Most toothbrushes are made from non-biodegradable plastics such as nylon and polypropylene, so they can take up to 400 years to decompose in landfills. By switching to a Bamboo Toothbrush, you can drastically reduce your carbon footprint and make a positive impact on the environment.  Our Bamboo Toothbrushes are also certified cruelty-free by PETA, so you can brush with confidence knowing that no animals were harmed in the making of your toothbrush.  If you're looking for a more sustainable and eco-friendly option for your oral hygiene routine, consider making the switch to a Bamboo Toothbrush. It's a small change that can make a big difference for the environment.

By John Manganaro  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that an investment adviser firm has agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty to settle charges that it failed to adequately supervise its employees' compliance with certain marketing rules.  According to the SEC's order instituting a cease-and-desist proceeding, Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC violated the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by failing to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of Rule 206(4)-3 under the Advisers Act, commonly known as the "Cash Solicitation Rule."  The Cash Solicitation Rule prohibits investment advisers from giving or agreeing to give cash or cash equivalent payments to a client or a client's broker-dealer for recommending or securing advisory business, subject to certain exceptions.

It refers to investments made into companies that meet certain environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria. However, for companies themselves, managing their ESG risks is just as important.  The World Economic Forum estimates that ignoring ESG risks could lead to financial losses of up to $4.2 trillion by 2030. With such high stakes at play, companies need to have a comprehensive understanding of their ESG risks. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes into play.  Artificial intelligence can help companies identify, monitor, and manage their ESG risks more effectively. Here's how:  1. Data Collection and Analysis  Collecting and analyzing data related to ESG risks can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task. AI can help automate this process, making it faster and more efficient. By using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, AI systems can scan large volumes of data from various sources, including regulatory filings, news articles, and social media, to identify relevant ESG issues.  2. Risk Scoring and Prioritization

Review: I think that the Outsiders is a very good book that people could relate to in one way or another. Even though it is a fictional story, the situations could happen in real life. It shows how being from the "wrong side of town" can really affect everyone around you. The book is about two gangs (one is poor and the other is rich) that don't like each other. In the book, many different events happen that are both exciting and have a big effect on the story. Because of these events, the book is very interesting and entertaining. There are many different things that happen which cause conflicts for the characters. All these conflicts keep you guessing and wanting to read more because you never know what will happen next. In my opinion, this is an excellent book for teenagers to read. Answer:  A: Positive  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Very Good!

Investigating the case, Lieutenant Polouse considers three motives for the crime: jealousy, money, and vengeance. He dismisses jealousy out of sympathy for Mildred and because there is no evidence Vda. Lucy Pierce was romantically involved with Monte, and Mildred would not be jealously protective of her second husband. For the same reasons, he is inclined to rule out revenge as a motive, leaving only financial reasons as the probable cause for the murder. Beragon was insured for $1,000,000, which would have been paid largely to Mildred. While they were hardly in dire financial straits, the extra money would have come in handy: their daughter Veda was an expensive child, aspiring to be "socially prominent". Mildred makes an accounting for Lieutenant Polouse of the money paid

A: Here is one way to do it:  <?php  $array = [1,2,3,4,5];  $csv = fopen('output.csv', 'w');  fputcsv($csv, $array);  fclose($csv);  ?>  This will create a CSV file called output.csv with one row and one column containing your array.

But my experience was quite different. First off, the service was terrible. Our waiter was very rude and seemed annoyed with us every time we asked him something. He hardly came by to refill our drinks or check up on us. Secondly, the food was just ok. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was pretty good. For our entrees we ordered the meatloaf and the chicken fried steak. The meatloaf was dry and bland. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and lacked flavor. The chicken fried steak was huge but the gravy tasted like it came straight out of a can. The only saving grace was the dessert. We ordered the bread pudding and it was delicious. Overall, I probably won't be coming back here. There are too many other great restaurants in Vegas to settle for mediocre food and bad service.  Q: negative  A: This place is disgusting.  They have no concept of cleanliness.  The floors are sticky, the tables are sticky, the utensils are dirty.  It's gross.  The food isn't much better.  The meats are low quality and overcooked.  The

Legislators want to study gun violence in New Mexico  Gov. Susana Martinez's administration wants to start charging fees for copies of public records.  The governor's office submitted a proposal to the Legislative Finance Committee that would allow state agencies to charge for copies of public records under the state's Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA).  Currently, there is no fee for copies of public records, though some agencies do charge for copies of other documents, such as birth certificates.  According to KOB-TV, which first reported the story, the proposed changes would allow agencies to charge up to $1 per page for paper copies and up to $10 for electronic copies.  This isn't the first time the Martinez administration has tried to change the public records law.  In 2013, Martinez v

Academic journal article Journal of Marriage and Family  The Effects of Parental Divorce on Children's Educational Attainment: Longitudinal Evidence From the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health  By Amato, Paul R.; Sobolewski, Joseph T.  This study investigated the long-term effects of parental divorce on children's educational attainment using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The analyses included 15,740 respondents who were followed from adolescence into young adulthood. We controlled for numerous family background variables, including family socioeconomic status, parental education, and parental monitoring. Results indicated that children of divorce were less likely to have graduated from high school by age 24 and were less likely to have earned a bachelor's degree by age 26. They also were less likely to have enrolled in college by age 24. These effects remained significant even when controlling for family background characteristics.  Divorce is associated with many negative outcomes for children (Amato, 1993, 1994, 1

There are $n$ distinct objects. I want to calculate the number of ways to arrange these objects such that no two identical objects are adjacent to each other.  For example, for $n=3$, there are $6$ arrangements:  123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321  My attempt:  Let $a_n$ be the number of arrangements for $n$ distinct objects.  We can consider the first object. There are $n$ choices for the first object.  After choosing the first object, we have $a_{n-1}$ ways to arrange the remaining $n-1$ objects such that no two identical objects are adjacent to each other.  Therefore, $a_n = n \cdot a_{n-1}$.  Using this recursive formula, we can calculate $a_n$ for small values of $n$.  For $n=3$, $a_3 = 3 \cdot a_2 = 3 \cdot (2 \cdot a_1) = 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 1) = 6$.  For $n=4$, $a_4 = 4 \cdot a_3 = 4 \cdot

Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after having been chased down by Monte, who survived long enough to whisper the news before he died. Mildred protests that he is reunited with his wife, Lucy, who remarried after thinking that Bernt was dead, before succumbing to his wounds.  The investigating officer, Detective Finlay, reprimands Mildred for not attending to her husband, implying that the murder could have been prevented if she was more caring towards him.  Mildred, branded in the press as a "wealthy widow", leaves for Rancho Carmelita to be with Bert's son from his first marriage, Monte Beragon. Arriving there, she is confronted by Bruno Anthony, whose Spanish-born mother worked for the Beragons when he was a child. Bruno's character insinuates that both Bert and Monte were weak men, dominated by Mildred and their respective stepmothers.  At the ranch, Mildred tells Monte that she wants to sell it back to him, having kept her promise to live with Bert for a year following their divorce. Monte reveals

Cut the plywood into four sides (two long and two short) and a bottom piece using a saw.  2. **Assemble the sides**: Arrange the four sides so that the longer sides are facing each other. Apply wood glue to the edges that will form the corners of the box. Use clamps to hold the corners tightly together while the glue dries. Alternatively, you can use nails or screws to secure the corners temporarily until the glue dries.  3. **Attach the bottom**: Once the sides are securely attached, apply wood glue to the bottom

If you have been reading my previous blogs, you know that I am a big proponent of chiropractic care for children. There are so many benefits to getting your child adjusted regularly, but today I want to focus on just one of those benefits: ear infections.  Ear infections are incredibly common in children. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), nearly all children will have had at least one ear infection by the time they turn three years old. That's a lot of kids with a lot of ear infections.  So what causes ear infections? Eustachian tubes connect the middle ear to the back of the nose. When these tubes become blocked, fluid can build up in the middle ear, leading to an infection. This blockage is often caused by allergies, colds, or other upper respiratory infections.  Symptoms of an ear infection include fever, fussiness, tugging or pulling at the ears, trouble sleeping, difficulty hearing, and fluid draining from the ear.  The most common treatment for ear infections is antibiotics. However, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, more than half of all ear infections are caused by viruses,

A redesigned version of Audi's Q5 Sportback has been spotted testing ahead of a likely debut in the second half of 2021.  The Q5 Sportback is a coupe-like version of the Q5 crossover introduced for the 2020 model year. The regular Q5 was last redesigned for the 2018 model year so it's only fitting that the Q5 Sportback gets its own redesign.  Despite the heavy camouflage, we can see that the redesigned Q5 Sportback will adopt the same design language as the recently revealed redesigned Q5. This means a more upright grille with a hexagonal shape, slightly angled headlights, and a sleeker profile.  Inside, the Q5 Sportback will feature a digital instrument cluster and touchscreen infotainment system similar to what's found in the new Q5. The materials will also be upgraded, and Audi will offer the latest driver-assist and connectivity features.  Under the skin, the Q5 Sportback will ride on the Volkswagen Group

By the end of January some of the channels started fizzing out so we decided to use channels 5 and 6 which seemed to work the best for us. We still used the product up until last night when suddenly an actual antenna popped out after I turned it to reposition it... Without even touching the antenna!! This product is certainly not worth the price I paid for it. It goes back to the store today for a full refund.  The answer to this question is:  dissatisfied

To compile the report, Black Book surveyed more than 1,300 C-suite executives and IT decision-makers at hospitals, health systems, clinics, and physician practices between September and November 2019. According to the report, the top three cybersecurity challenges facing healthcare organizations today are:  • Keeping up with rapidly evolving technology (47% of respondents)  • Protecting patient data privacy (46%)  • Ensuring regulatory compliance (45%)  Other notable challenges identified in the report include:  • Securing third-party vendors and partners (44%)  • Managing limited budgets and resources (43%)  • Preparing for and responding to cyberattacks (42%)  "Cybersecurity is one of the top priorities for healthcare organizations today," said Doug Brown, managing partner at Black Book.

The Trade Finance Operations Guidance provides practical recommendations for banks and other financial institutions to facilitate trade finance transactions amidst the evolving challenges posed by the global health crisis. It outlines best practices for managing risks associated with physical document handling, remote working, cybersecurity, fraud prevention, and anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance.  The publication draws on the expertise of the ICC Banking Commission's Working Group on Trade Finance Operations, which includes representatives from leading financial institutions worldwide. It is designed to complement existing ICC guidance on trade finance operations, including the ICC Guide to Digital Trade Correspondent Banking and the ICC Guide to Digitisation of Documentary Credits.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many financial institutions have accelerated their digitisation efforts to mitigate the impact of disruptions to traditional trade finance operations.

I am trying to create a list of lists where each inner list is sorted. For example, if I have this list:  my_list = [[3, 4, 1], [5, 2, 6], [9, 8, 7]]  The output should be:  [[1, 3, 4], [2, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]  Here is my code:  my_list = [[3, 4, 1], [5, 2, 6], [9, 8, 7]]  sorted_list = []  for sublist in my_list:      sublist.sort()      sorted_list.append(sublist)  print(sorted_list)  However, when I run this code, the output is the same as the input (my_list). Can someone explain why this is happening and how to fix it?  A: The problem with your code is that you are sorting the sublists in-place, which means that the changes made to the sublists are reflected in the original my_list variable.  To fix this, you can create a copy of the sublist before sorting it:  my_list = [[3, 4, 1

Lamborghini on Thursday revealed the open-top version of its range-topping Aventador SVJ supercar at Monterey Car Week.  Called the Aventador SVJ Roadster, the car features the same carbon fiber monocoque as the coupe, albeit with reinforcements to account for the lack of a roof. It also has the same active aerodynamics setup which includes a rear wing that extends up to 4.3 inches above the body when required.  The powertrain is also the same as the coupe's, meaning there's a 6.5-liter V-12 good for 759 hp and 531 lb-ft of torque. Drive is to all four wheels via a 7-speed automated manual transmission, and Lamborghini quotes a 0-62 mph time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 217 mph.  2020 Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster  As with the coupe, the Roadster benefits from the brand's second-generation Magneto Rheological Suspension

A: This place is terrible. I went here with my boyfriend and his family for a quick bite to eat before heading back to LA. The service was slow and the food was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and it came out well done. When we told the waitress she apologized and took it back to the kitchen. We waited another 20 minutes for his burger to come back out. At this point we were ready to just leave but he was still hungry so he ate it. The fries were soggy and bland. The shakes weren't anything special either. Overall this place was a huge disappointment.  Q: negative  A: Went there last night around 9pm. We had reservation for 8 people. First off, our table wasn't ready when we got there even though we had reservation. Secondly, our waiter was really rude. He didn't smile once and seemed annoyed every time we asked him something. Thirdly, they ran out of steaks. What kind of steakhouse runs out of steaks? They said they could give us filet mignon instead which was $10 more expensive. We ended up cancelling our order and left. Will never go back there again.  Pro

I have a list of dictionaries which looks like this:  data = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 23, 'gender': 'M'}, {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 25, 'gender': 'F'}, {'name': 'Tom', 'age': 27, 'gender': 'M'}]  Is there a way to search for a specific name and return the age of that person? For example, if I want to search for "John" and return his age (23)?  A: You can use a list comprehension to filter the list of dictionaries based on the condition that the dictionary's 'name' key is equal to 'John'. Then, you can access the 'age' key of the filtered dictionary.  result = next((dictionary for dictionary in data if dictionary['name'] == 'John'), None)  if result:      age = result['age']  else:      age = None  print(age)  Output:  23  A: You can use a list comprehension to filter the list of dictionaries based on the condition that the dictionary's 'name' key is equal to 'John'.

The process of kneading the dough, watching it rise, and seeing it transform into a golden-brown loaf is both satisfying and rewarding. But if you don't have the time or energy to make bread from scratch, store-bought bread might seem like the next best option. However, many store-bought breads contain ingredients that aren't ideal for our health or the environment. That's where sprouted grain bread comes in.  Sprouted grain bread is made from grains that have been soaked, germinated, and then ground into flour. This process makes the nutrients in the grains more bioavailable, meaning they are easier for our bodies to absorb and use. Sprouted grains are also lower in phytic acid, which can interfere with the absorption of essential minerals like calcium, magnesium, and iron.  In addition to being more nutritious, sprouted grain bread is also better for the environment. Traditional wheat processing involves removing the bran and germ during milling, which reduces the nutritional value of the flour. By using sprouted grains, we can make better use of the whole grain, reducing food waste and preserving the nutrients that would otherwise be discarded.  When choosing sprouted grain bread,

Registered nurses (RNs) provide and coordinate patient care, educate patients and the public about various health conditions, and provide emotional support and advice to patients' family members. They make judgments about patients' health and well-being, and may order and perform diagnostic tests when necessary. Registered nurses usually work in hospitals, physicians' offices, and long-term care facilities. Some RNs work in schools, rehabilitation centers, and home healthcare services. Most registered nurses work full time. Overtime and weekend work may be required.  Registered nurses typically need an associate's or bachelor's degree in nursing, although a diploma from an approved nursing program may suffice, and all state require licensure. Registered nurses must pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) to become licensed. Some states require or prefer that applicants for licensure graduate from an accredited nursing program. Nurses who want to advance to management positions may need a master's

A: I have been going to this location for several years. The food is usually good. However, the service has gone down hill. It takes forever to get your food and they always seem to forget something. Today was the last straw. We went for lunch today with two other couples. We were seated promptly but then waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes passed before we received our drinks. We ordered appetizers and entrees. The appetizers came out quickly. Then we waited another 45 minutes for our entrees. By this time one of the couples had to leave because they were late for an appointment. They didn't even have time to eat their appetizer. When the waitress came over to ask how everything was we told her about our friend having to leave because they were waiting so long. She said she would let the manager know. The manager never came over to speak with us. Our bill came and they did not take anything off for the appetizer or the entree for the friend that had to leave. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location.  Q: positive  A: This place is awesome. My husband and I have been here twice now and both times we left very satisfied. The first time we went we got the Chicken Fried

The food is wonderful and the service is even better. It's always busy but worth the wait. I have never had a bad meal here.  Q: negative  A: Very disappointed with my experience at this location. My wife and I were looking forward to trying out this restaurant after hearing so many good things about it. When we walked in there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us. We stood there for a few minutes before someone finally came up to seat us. After being seated we waited another 10 minutes before our waitress came over to take our drink order. She seemed very disinterested in her job and rushed through taking our order. We ordered the nachos appetizer and they were very bland and nothing special. For our entrees we ordered the filet mignon and the ribeye. Both steaks were cooked properly but lacked any flavor. They weren't terrible but certainly not worth the price. Our waitress didn't check on us once during our meal and we had to flag her down when we were finished to get our check. Overall the food and service were subpar and we will not be returning to this location.  Problem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive)

Input:  Turn_Me_On_(album)  producer  The_Honeymoon_Killers_(American_band)   Output:   We have all heard the phrase "an apple a day keeps the doctor away." However, there is more to this phrase than just a catchy saying. Apples are packed with nutrients and health benefits that make them a powerful addition to any diet. In this blog post, we will explore some of the top reasons why apples should be a regular part of your daily routine.  1. High in Fiber: Apples are an excellent source of dietary fiber, which is essential for maintaining healthy digestion. One medium-sized apple contains around 4.4 grams of fiber, which is approximately 17% of the recommended daily intake for adults.  2. Rich in Antioxidants: Apples contain high levels of antioxidants, particularly quercetin and catechin. These antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease.  3. Promotes Heart Health: Studies have shown that consuming apples regularly can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of developing heart disease. The soluble fiber in apples binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract, preventing it from being absorbed into the bloodstream.  4. Aids Weight Loss: Apples are low in calories (around 94 calories per medium-sized apple) and high in

It is very well defined with fine delineation. The palate is medium-bodied with fine tannin, perfectly judged acidity and great harmony. There is intensity here, perhaps more than the Pessac-Léognan first growths this year, with hints of white pepper towards the finish. This is a brilliant La Mission Haut-Brion for the cellar.

In his first major speech since becoming prime minister, Boris Johnson this week called for a "new chapter" in community relations.  He spoke of the need to confront extremism and hatred in all its forms – whether Islamophobia, antisemitism or racism.  Johnson is right to recognise that Britain faces a serious problem with religious extremism and bigotry.  But his words ring hollow when set against the government's record on tackling anti-Muslim hatred specifically.  Earlier this month the government published its long-awaited response to the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims' inquiry into Islamophobia in public life.  The APPG's report, published in September 2019, made a series of recommendations to address the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice.  While the government accepted many of these recommendations, it failed to take decisive action on some of the most important issues.  For example, the APPG recommended that the government adopt

It's got that punk blues vibe. I can't help but feel that Zakk is really a blues musician at heart. He's fantastic with that slide guitar. At times he reminds me of B.B. King. The songs are pretty good. Some of the tracks could have been more refined, but that's always the case with punk music. My personal favorites are Crazy Horse, Sunday Morning 6AM, and Hard Road. This release really showcases Zakk's darker side. Enjoy!

For many people, this means setting resolutions for self-improvement, whether it's losing weight, quitting a bad habit, or saving more money. While these goals are admirable, they can often be difficult to stick to over the long term. However, there is one resolution that is both achievable and highly beneficial: making your home more energy efficient.  By making your home more energy efficient, you can save money on your utility bills, reduce your carbon footprint, and create a more comfortable living environment. Here are some practical steps you can take to make your home more energy efficient in 2023:  1. Insulate your home: Proper insulation helps regulate the temperature inside your home, reducing the need for frequent heating or cooling. Make sure your attic, walls, and floors are well-insulated.  2. Install weather stripping: Weather stripping around doors and windows can prevent drafts and keep your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer.  3. Upgrade to energy-efficient appliances: Replacing old appliances with ENERGY STAR-certified models can significantly reduce your energy consumption. Focus on upgrading your refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher, and dryer first.  4. Switch to

Coffee Jr., Columbia Law School,Follow this and additional works at: https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/574  This Article explores the relationship between sovereign immunity and personal jurisdiction over foreign states. The Supreme Court's recent decision in Fed. Republic of Germany v. Philipp, 485 U.S. 438 (1988), held that the Eleventh Amendment does not preclude federal courts from exercising personal jurisdiction over foreign states. This conclusion is consistent with the Court's prior decisions holding that the Eleventh Amendment applies only to suits by citizens against their own state. However, the Philipp decision has been widely misinterpreted as endorsing the view that foreign states can be subjected to general personal jurisdiction in the United States. This Article argues that such an interpretation is inconsistent with the traditional principles governing personal jurisdiction over non-resident defendants. In particular, the Court's later decision in Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), which was decided shortly after Philipp, suggests that foreign states should ordin

Answer: My husband and I have been going to this location for several years. The food has always been good and the service acceptable. However, our most recent experience was disappointing. When we arrived there were only two other tables occupied. We were seated promptly but waited at least 10 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. Our server seemed disinterested and distracted throughout our meal. She never checked back to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything else. When she brought our check she asked if we wanted boxes for our leftovers. We said yes and she took our check without offering us a chance to box up our own food. We waited another 10 minutes for her to bring our change back. Needless to say we will not be returning to this location.  Input: OPT

It now goes to the Senate, where Democrats hold a filibuster-proof majority and plan to change it substantially before sending it back to the House.  Republicans say they want to use the must-pass spending measure to make a down payment on the $100 billion in cuts they promised during their campaign for the House majority last fall. But Democrats argue that the reductions sought by the Republicans would cripple popular programs and impede the economic recovery.  Mr. Boehner has insisted that the House will not pass another stopgap measure to keep the government running if the Senate does not accept the House version. That could lead to a government shutdown when the current stopgap measure expires on March 4.  The White House has threatened to veto the House bill if it reaches President Obama’s desk.  Democrats complained that the House Republican cuts were too deep and too indiscriminate. They singled out money for Head Start, community development block grants, Pell Grants for college students, health care for poor women and children

I want to create a user defined data type in SQL Server. For example, I want to create a new data type named Fruit which will have values such as Apple, Orange, Banana, etc.  A: You can create a User Defined Table Type (UDT) in SQL Server. This allows you to define a structure for your data that can be used within stored procedures and functions. However, this is different from creating a new data type in the sense that you cannot use Fruit as a data type for a column in a table.  To create a UDT, follow these steps:  1. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to your database server.  2. Expand the Databases node and select the database where you want to create the UDT.  3. Right-click the Tables folder and select New Table...  4. In the New Table dialog box, specify a name for your UDT (e.g., dbo.Fruits).  5. Add columns to represent the attributes of your fruit objects. For example:  ```sql  CREATE TYPE dbo.Fruits AS TABLE (      FruitID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,      FruitName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,      Color VARCHAR(

ORNL scientists have developed a first-of-its-kind computer model that can predict corrosion rates for nuclear power plant heat exchangers. The tool will help plant operators better understand how their equipment is aging and when repairs or replacements are needed, potentially saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs. Heat exchangers transfer heat between two fluids that do not come into direct contact with each other. In a nuclear power plant, they are used to cool the reactor core and convert steam back into water. Over time, the heat exchangers can corrode, which decreases their efficiency and could lead to premature failure. Understanding the rate of corrosion is critical to maintaining the safety and reliability of the plant. Plant operators currently monitor corrosion by removing small pieces of the heat exchanger tubes for analysis. This process is expensive, time-consuming, and disrupts plant operations. "This approach only provides a snapshot of the

The victim was a 48-year-old man from Zhejiang province in eastern China, who died on Dec 15, the official Xinhua news agency said.  He had visited a live poultry market before falling ill with symptoms including fever, coughing and chest tightness, Xinhua said.  The H7N9 strain of bird flu first appeared in humans in China in 2013 and led to more than 1,000 deaths over the following five years.  Since 2017, however, there have only been sporadic cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).  The WHO says the risk of human-to-human transmission of H7N9 is considered low.  In December last year, China reported its first human infection with the H7N9 strain since November 2017.  Join ST's Telegram channel here and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Instead it told me things about fruitarianism I already know such as to chew thoroughly and enjoy my food. Don't get me wrong those are good things but that isn't what I was expecting. I guess it's a good book if you're new to fruitarianism but for someone who's been doing this a while I found it repetitive and boring.  Answer:  dissatisfied

DOI: 10.4236/ajorc.2018.53012 PDF HTML XML 485 Downloads 1,034 Views Citations  In this paper, a new approach is proposed for scheduling problems with minimizing total weighted tardiness. This approach is based on a new function named "tardiness rate" which is derived from the total weighted tardiness. The main idea of this approach is to minimize the tardiness rate instead of total weighted tardiness. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, some numerical examples have been solved and compared with existing approaches. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the performance of the system.  Scheduling, Total Weighted Tardiness, Tard

And finally, this past weekend, that dream came true.   My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bellagio for two nights for his birthday. We decided to splurge a little bit and booked a room in the Spa Tower with a view of the fountains. The room was absolutely gorgeous. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the view was breathtaking.   The only reason why I'm giving the Bellagio 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service we received at the front desk. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk wasn't very friendly. She didn't even make eye contact with us once while she was checking us in. Then, when we got to our room, we realized that there were no clean towels in the bathroom. We called the front desk and asked if they could send some up.

A: Love this place! I have been going here for years and they always do a great job. The staff is super friendly and the prices are fair. They also have a punch card so after 10 pedicures you get one free. My only complaint is that they can get pretty busy during the weekends so plan accordingly.  Q: positive  A: This place is AWESOME! I am so glad that I found this place through Yelp. It is really clean and has a very nice atmosphere. The food was amazing. I had the grilled chicken salad and it was delicious.

A: The food is good but the service is awful. Everytime I go there they mess up my order somehow. Today was the last straw. I called in an order for pick up. When I got there they gave me someone else's order. Then they had to make my order which took another 15 minutes. When I got home I realized they gave me the wrong drink too. This place is close to my house so I keep giving them chances but I don't think I will be going back.  Q: negative  A: This place used to be great. But since they changed ownership its gone downhill. The food is bland and over priced. The new owners have no idea how to run a restaurant. They need to get rid of the snooty hostess and hire people who know what they are doing.  Problem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) review?  Answer: We went here for lunch today because we were staying at the hotel and didn't feel like leaving the property. It was just ok. The food was mediocre and overpriced. The service was slow even though the place was nearly empty. Our waitress was nice enough but kind of forgetful. She forgot to bring us silverware

Eager to uncover the truth behind the artist's disappearance, Emma embarks on a journey that takes her across Europe. Along the way, she meets other descendants of the artist's muses, all of whom have been searching for answers in their own lives.

A: We came here because we had a buy one get one free coupon. The food was ok but nothing special. It's pretty expensive for what you get. The service was terrible. Our waitress didn't come back to refill our drinks until we were almost done with our meal. When we asked for the check she brought us the wrong one. I don't think we'll be coming back.  Q: negative  A: This place is sooooooo overrated. My friends raved about this place so I decided to give it a try. Now I know why they raved about it. It must have been the first time they ever tried sushi. The sushi rolls are too big and fall apart when you try to pick them up with your chopsticks. The fish doesn't taste fresh at all. They put way too much rice in their rolls. The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24hrs. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

My most recent visit was this past weekend.  We had a party of 12 and made reservations two weeks in advance.  When we arrived they did not have our reservation.  They told us it would be a 30 minute wait.  After waiting for 45 minutes we were finally seated.  It took another 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  Another 15 minutes went by before anyone came back to take our food order.  We waited another 45 minutes for our food to arrive.  The food was mediocre at best.  The only reason this place gets two stars instead of one is because the manager did comp our entire meal.  I will never go back to this location again.

A: I was so excited to try this place out because of all the great reviews but I have to say I was extremely disappointed.  We ordered the pork rinds and they were just ok. The salsa that came with them was really good though. Then we ordered the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich. The brisket was very fatty and didn't have much flavor. The pulled pork was dry and lacked flavor as well. The only thing that was good was the macaroni and cheese. I don't think I will be going back.  Q: negative  A: It's been awhile since I've been here, but I do remember why I haven't been back. The food was bland and overpriced. There are better places to eat in Las Vegas.

Food was delicious and beautifully presented.  My husband had the lamb shank and I had the filet mignon.  Both were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths.  The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced.

The second time I ordered orange chicken and it was soggy and way too sweet. Service was slow both times. There are much better Chinese restaurants in the area.

They gave us a table right next to the kitchen entrance where all the servers were constantly coming in and out. It was very annoying.   We ordered the following:  Stuffed Mushrooms - pretty good, mushrooms were cooked just right and the stuffing was flavorful. Crab stuffed Shrimp - this was probably the best thing we ordered. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the crab stuffing was delicious. Lobster Bisque - mediocre at best. Too thick and lacked flavor. Seafood Platter - disappointing. The scallops were rubbery and overcooked. The shrimps were small and nothing special. The fish was ok. Salmon - this was probably the worst salmon I've ever had. It was dry and tasteless.

Title: Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book Review: This is a fantastical book that will appeal to fairy and fairy tale lovers due to its lush illustrations and unique concept. It purports to be a book illustrated and filled with hand-pressed fairy snapshots by one Lady Rozamund Mary Cottington, a citizen of the Secret Commonwealth of Fairyland, in the years 1862-1911. The book is "her" attempt to share her adventure with the mortal world. Her hand pressed the fairies close enough to leave an imprint on various pages of the book using a secret process. Each fairy is captioned with name, classification, and place in Fairyland.And no two copies of the book are the same due to "her" use of different pages for the fairy presses. Other items such as feathers, leaves, and flowers may be embedded in the pages as well. Beware any that have what looks like real feces encased in lucite on page 23, said to be from a dung beetle fairy named Maude.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and both agreed that they needed to try again to close a $24.3 billion budget gap.  The Senate leader, Darrell Steinberg, also a Democrat, called the vote “a disappointment” and said he was working with Mr. Brown to see if they could come up with a different plan.  Democrats hold a supermajority in both houses of the Legislature, but they need two-thirds support to pass a budget or raise taxes. But Assemblyman Sam Blakeslee, a moderate Republican from San Luis Obispo, said his party was united against the tax increase.  “There’s no question that our caucus is solidly opposed to it,” Mr. Blakeslee said.  The measure would have raised the state sales tax by 1 percentage point, to 8.25 percent, and increased income taxes on individuals making more than $250,000 a year and couples making more than $500,000. It would have generated about $12 billion over the next 18 months.

Q: negative  A: My wife and I have been going to this location for over 10 years. We used to go once or twice a week. Recently we went there for lunch and were told they no longer serve half sandwiches. They said they could give us a full sandwich and take off $1.00. Really? A full sandwich is $9.00 so now you want me to pay $8.00 for a half sandwich. No thanks. As we were leaving we asked to speak to the manager. He came over and we explained why we were leaving.

Input:  Brandon_Carter  doctoralAdvisor  Dennis_William_Sciama ,  Brandon_Carter  birthDate  1942-01-01 ,  Brandon_Carter  birthPlace  England   Output:   Q: Why do we need to define the type explicitly when using generics? I have been reading about generics in C# and I am having trouble understanding why we need to explicitly define the type for the generic class.  For example:  Dictionary<string, string> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();  Why can't we just do this:  Dictionary myDictionary = new Dictionary();  Also, what is the difference between these two lines of code:  Dictionary<string, string> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();  Dictionary<string> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();  A: The first line creates a dictionary with keys and values of type string.  The second line creates a dictionary with keys of type string and values of type object.  In order to know which type to use for the key and value, the compiler needs to know both types.  Without specifying the types, the compiler wouldn't know which type to use for the key and which type to use for the value.  This could lead to unexpected behavior if you tried to use the dictionary in a way that depends on the types of the key and value.  A: As others have said, because without specifying the types, the compiler doesn't know which type to use for the key and which type to use for the value.  As far as your second question goes, let'

The first chapter actually gets you going, since it deals with a mysterious ancient maps and treasures. But then, from chapter two on, the book just doesn't make sense anymore. It deals with family problems (the author tries to make the family of the protagonist seem deep and full of dark secrets, trying to give the book some thrill, but it just gets boring and annoying), a too-sudden death that nobody seems to care about (maybe because it happened in the past), and computer games. And, to top it all, this book has one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Let's just say it ends with nothing accomplished, and the characters are taken out of the blue to a ridiculous place (literally). I just don't understand how this can be a James Rollins book.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Not so good Review: This book wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't great either. For the first few chapters, nothing really happens- it just seems to go on and on describing the "cyberpunk" world. Speaking of which, the term "cyberpunk" turns out to be quite misleading; forget what you know about "hackers" and "The Matrix": in this story, "cyberpunk" simply refers to a sort of fashion style, as far as I could tell.The characters are fairly cliché, but likable nonetheless. The stories of the different characters have some interesting elements, but most of them seem rather predictable.However, despite all this, the book picks up speed towards the end. The end itself was quite satisfying, and somewhat thought-provoking.So, if you don't mind spending time waiting for the good part, then I'd say go ahead and give this one a try.  Answer:  dissatisfied

Mercedes-Benz has been spotted testing a new version of its S63 AMG Coupe Shooting Brake, this time with a more potent biturbo 5.5-liter V-8 under the hood. The engine is the same unit found in the S63 AMG sedan and coupe, where it delivers 577 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque.

Input:  Bedford_Aerodrome  operatingOrganisation  MotorSport_Vision ,  MotorSport_Vision  foundedBy  Jonathan_Palmer ,  MotorSport_Vision  foundingYear  2004 ,  Bedford_Aerodrome  location  Thurleigh   Output:   In today's fast-paced world, people are constantly looking for ways to make their lives easier and more convenient. One area where this is particularly evident is in the realm of online shopping. With the rise of e-commerce, consumers now have the ability to browse, compare, and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes. This has led to a significant shift in consumer behavior, with more and more people opting for the convenience of online shopping over traditional brick-and-mortar stores.  One of the key advantages of online shopping is the vast selection of products available. Unlike physical stores, which are limited by their physical space, online retailers can offer an almost limitless range of items. This allows consumers to easily find exactly what they are looking for, regardless of whether it's a common item or a hard-to-find niche product.  Another major advantage of online shopping is the ability to easily compare prices and features across multiple sellers. A simple search can yield results from numerous retailers, making it easy for consumers to find the best value for their money. This level of transparency promotes healthy competition among sellers, ultimately benefiting the consumer through lower prices and better products.  Online shopping also offers the convenience of being able to shop at any time, day or night. Consumers no longer have to worry about store hours or traveling to a physical location. They can simply browse

UBS Financial Services Inc. has agreed to pay more than $6 million to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it failed to supervise its brokers for excessive mutual fund trading, known as churning.  According to the SEC's order, between 2009 and 2013, UBS received numerous red flags indicating that certain brokers were excessively trading mutual fund shares in their customers' accounts. Despite these red flags, UBS failed to implement reasonable supervisory procedures to detect and prevent excessive trading. The firm also failed to adequately train its branch managers to identify and address excessive trading.  The SEC's order finds that UBS caused violations of Section 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder, which impose a duty on investment advisers to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of

Input:  Andrzej_Piotr_Ruszczyński  professionalField  Mathematical_optimization   Output:   It's been quite some time since I last posted here, but I've been busy with work and other things. Now that we're getting closer to the end of the year, I wanted to write about one of my favorite subjects: The weather.  In particular, I want to talk about temperature and precipitation trends over the past few decades in the United States. We know that globally, temperatures have risen and extreme weather events have become more frequent, but what does this mean for us here in the U.S.?  According to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average annual temperature in the contiguous United States has increased by about 1.6°F (0.9°C) since record-keeping began in 1895. This may not sound like much, but it's important to note that most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s. In fact, the decade from 2010 to 2019 was the warmest on record for the U.S., with an average temperature of 54.3°F (12.4°C).  As for precipitation, the picture is a bit more complex. Overall, the U.S. has seen an increase in precipitation since the late 19th century, with an average increase of about 4% per century

This unit is more comfortable and performs much better than the previous one. The volume control on the headset is a great feature. It allowed her to adjust the volume to exactly what she wanted without any extra electronics. She said it feels a little loose on the back of her head but it doesn't fall off or move when she bends over or anything like that. Great purchase, highly recommend.  (A).  increase  (Q).

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump met with students, parents and teachers affected by school shootings at the White House to discuss ways to prevent future tragedies.  During the meeting, Trump said he is open to raising the minimum age requirement for purchasing some firearms from 18 to 21. He also said he supports arming teachers who undergo "rigorous" police-like training.  Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Cameron Kasky, who helped organize the March for Our Lives rally scheduled for March 24 in Washington, D.C., questioned why the president has not taken more action to curb gun violence.  "President Trump, you said that you were listening to us," Kasky said. "You said that you wanted to be our ally. You said you wanted to take actions against the violence that allows me to come here and bury another one of my friends next week. But the only thing that you've taken steps to do is to make it easier for people to buy assault rifles like the one that killed 17 of my friends and wounded many more of us."  In response, Trump told Kasky that he

Input:  ALCO_RS-3  buildDate  "May 1950 - August 1956" ,  ALCO_RS-3  builder  American_Locomotive_Company ,  ALCO_RS-3  cylinderCount  12   Output:   Q: Prove that if $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then $f'(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. I tried using the epsilon-delta definition of continuity, but I couldn't figure out how to show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|f'(x) - f'(c)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x - c| < \delta$.  Any hints or solutions would be appreciated.  A: Since $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, we know that for each $x$ in $(a,b)$, there exists a $\delta_x>0$ such that $|f(x+h)-f(x)-f'(x)h|<\epsilon$ for all $0<|h|<\delta_x$.  Let $c\in [a,b]$. If $c\in (a,b)$, then take $\delta=\delta_c$.  If $c=a$ or $c=b$, then choose $\delta>0$ such that $c+\delta$ or $c-\delta$ is in $(a,b)$.  In both cases, we have $|f(x+h)-f(x)-f'(x)h|<\epsilon$ for all $0<

In its quarterly economic update, the Minneapolis Fed also said it expects inflation to remain below the Fed's 2 percent annual target through 2017.  The central bank's revised outlook is in line with other recent downward revisions by the Fed and private economists.  "Global economic conditions continue to evolve in ways that create uncertainty," said Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, who has been one of the most dovish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. "As a result, we have lowered our projection for real GDP growth in 2016."  Kocherlakota will leave the Fed when his term expires in October.  The nine-member FOMC last month left its key short-term interest rate unchanged in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5

Input:  Ciudad_Ayala  isPartOf  Morelos   Output:   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a new version of its Cybersecurity Framework on April 16, 2018. This voluntary framework provides a common language for communicating cybersecurity risks and serves as a blueprint for organizations to manage and reduce those risks.  The updated Framework reflects changes in technology, cyber threats, and industry practices since the publication of the original Framework in 2014. It also includes clarifications and updates to the Framework's implementation tiers and profiles.  The Framework Core remains largely unchanged, with minor revisions to some categories and subcategories.  Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management has been added as a new category within the Identify function.  The Framework Implementation Tiers have been revised to better distinguish between reactive and proactive approaches to risk management.  The Framework Profiles have been updated to make it easier for organizations to document their current cybersecurity posture and articulate their goals for improvement.

On a warm summer night in Charleston, South Carolina, a month before his first birthday, Ben Chestnut disappeared from his crib. No evidence of a struggle. No bloodhound track. No sign of forced entry. He vanished without a trace—and was never found.  Twenty-seven years later, Ben's sister, Ashley, a dedicated journalist, is determined to finally discover the truth about what happened to her baby brother. Ashley's investigation takes her from the abandoned houses of the segregated South Side to St. John's Island, where the Chestnuts' ancestors endured 250 years of suffering as slaves. As she pieces together the story of her family's past, Ashley reconstructs the events of that fateful night and uncovers a decades-long pattern of lies, betrayal, and violence.  Told with the narrative skill and compassion that made The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks a #1 New York Times bestseller, The Beautiful Ones is a profoundly moving family saga that illuminates the forces that have shaped

In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he attracted large audiences by offering something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, occasionally for orchestra alone and occasionally with soloists or chorus, but always including lively items to appeal to all sections of the audience. It is in this category of popular classical concerts that the promenade concerts of Wood's time may be placed, and their success is due in large part to Wood's following in Sullivan's footsteps.At the opening concert on 10 July

The Lee County Board of County Commissioners broke ground on the new station Wednesday morning.  "This is the culmination of years of planning," said Lee County Commissioner Cecil Pendergrass. "It's great to see this come to fruition."  The new station will be located on Estero Boulevard between Old San Carlos Boulevard and Bowditch Point Park. It will replace the old station which was built in 1964.  Crews were able to get started on the project thanks to funding from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. A grant for $3.7 million was awarded to the county in June.  The new station will have more space for emergency vehicles and equipment. There will also be sleeping quarters for firefighters who work overnight shifts.

We live in Arizona and I found it to be a great way to help her understand and become familiar with animals from Africa without actually being there. I have all the books in the series and whenever I need a gift for a child, I buy one of these books.  Answer:  satisfied

I am learning javascript and I wrote this simple function to check if a string contains a given substring. The function returns undefined instead of true or false. Can someone explain why?  let hasSubstring = function(string, substring) {    if (string.indexOf(substring) !== -1) {      return true;    } else {      return false;    }  };  console.log(hasSubstring("test", "es"));  A: This is because indexOf returns -1 when the substring isn't found.  Change your code to:  let hasSubstring = function(string, substring) {    if (string.indexOf(substring) != -1) {      return true;    } else {      return false;    }  };  A: The indexOf() method returns -1 when the specified value is not present in the string.  So, you need to compare with != -1 instead of !== -1.  let hasSubstring = function(string, substring) {    if (string.indexOf(substring) != -1) {      return true;    } else {      return false;    }  };  console.log(hasSubstring("test", "es"));

To help you achieve your financial goals in 2023, we have compiled a list of actionable steps you can take throughout the year.  1. Create a budget and stick to it: Start by tracking your income and expenses to understand where your money is going. Then, create a realistic budget that allocates funds for necessities, savings, debt repayment, and discretionary spending.

After praying and struggling with God's plan, he returns to his slumber. The three disciples argue about who is the greatest among them as they head towards Jerusalem. Jesus tells them that "the first shall be last and the last shall be first" (Matthew 20:30-34). In Jerusalem, the Temple priests discuss a possible revolt and their need to keep the people under control. Barabbas, a rebel leader and murderer, is chained to have his right ear sliced off as punishment for murdering a Roman soldier, but is forgiven by the soldier in the name of Christ.

Academic journal article Journal of Marriage and Family  Parenting Practices and Adolescent Well-Being: A Comparison of Two Cohorts  By McLoyd, Vonnie M.; Duarte, Tiffany L.; Peterson, Glen H.  This study examined trends in parenting practices and their relation to adolescent well-being over a 20-year period. Using data from two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we investigated whether changes in parenting practices were associated with changes in adolescent self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and delinquent behavior among African American and European American adolescents. Results showed that parents became more involved in their adolescents' lives between Wave I (1994-1995) and Wave II (2001-2002). Parental monitoring increased for both African American and European American adolescents, whereas parental warmth increased only for European American adolescents. Changes in parenting practices were associated with changes in adolescent well-being. Specifically, increases in parental warmth and monitoring were associated with decreases in depressive symptoms

This is especially true when it comes to visual content for your business. According to HubSpot, social media posts with images receive 89% more likes than those without. Furthermore, according to MarketingProfs, 65% of executives visit a company's website after viewing a video. These statistics highlight the importance of incorporating visual content into your digital marketing strategy.  Visual content can come in many forms, including infographics, videos, memes, GIFs, photos, slideshows, and illustrations. Each type of visual content serves a different purpose and offers its own unique benefits. Let's take a closer look at some of these benefits.  Infographics are a great way to present complex information in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. By breaking down data into graphics, charts, and images, infographics make it easier for people to comprehend and remember the information presented. They can also help to increase organic traffic to your website, as they are highly shareable on social media platforms.  Videos are another powerful form of visual content. They allow you to showcase your product or service in action, convey emotion, and tell a story. Videos can also help to improve your search engine rankings, as Google prioritizes websites with multimedia content.  Memes and GIFs

They assume that because I am a life coach, I must have all the answers. The truth is, no one has all the answers. Not even me. Life coaching isn't about having all the answers, it's about helping people find their own answers within themselves.  It's about asking the right questions at the right time so that people can discover their own unique path forward. It's about providing a safe and supportive space for people to explore their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, and to gain clarity and insight into their own lives.  As a life coach, my role is to be a guide, a facilitator, and a sounding board. I help people identify their goals, overcome obstacles, and take action towards creating the life they want. I encourage them to tap into their inner wisdom and intuition, and empower them to make choices that align with their values and desires.  Ultimately, life coaching is about self-discovery, growth, and empowerment. It's about helping people connect with their true selves and unlock their full potential. And while I may not have all the answers, I have the tools, skills, and experience to help people find their own answers and create the life they truly desire.

Input:  Olga_Bondareva  almaMater  Leningrad_State_University   Output:   This blog post is part of a series called "Things I wish I knew when I started my PhD". Read the introduction here.  As a PhD student, you will write a lot. Every day, there will be some writing involved. It could be emails, lab notes, manuscripts, grant applications, reports, conference abstracts, progress reports, CVs, cover letters, PowerPoint presentations, etc.  The amount of writing varies greatly between different disciplines, but even in experimental sciences, writing is a big part of the job. In fact, many people have suggested that if you want to succeed in academia, you should spend 50% of your time doing research, 25% thinking about research, and 25% writing about research.  This means that you need to learn how to write well. As a PhD student, you will probably go through several drafts of your thesis, and you will likely submit multiple papers to journals before they get accepted. Writing is a skill that takes time to develop, so the earlier you start working on it, the better.  So, what can you do to improve your writing skills? Here are some suggestions.  Read a lot. The more you read, the more exposed you will be to different writing styles, sentence structures, vocabulary, and grammar. Reading also improves your understanding of the subject matter, which makes it easier for you to write about it.  Write

It is important to understand the significance of Jesus Christ in our lives and the potential outcomes of denying his existence and teachings.  Firstly, rejecting Jesus Christ means rejecting the foundation of Christianity, which is based on his life, teachings, death, and resurrection. This can lead to a lack of spiritual guidance, purpose, and meaning in one's life. Christianity offers hope, forgiveness, and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. Without this belief, individuals may struggle with feelings of emptiness, despair, and hopelessness.  Moreover, rejecting Jesus Christ can result in separation from God. According to Christian beliefs, Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the bridge between humanity and God. By rejecting Jesus, people cut themselves off from the possibility of reconciliation with God and entering into a personal relationship with Him.  Furthermore, rejecting Jesus Christ can also have eternal consequences. In Christianity, it is believed that after death, individuals will face judgment by God. Those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their savior will inherit eternal life in heaven, while those who have rejected him will face eternal punishment in hell.  In conclusion, rejecting Jesus Christ can lead to

Input:  Nie_Haisheng  nationality  People's_Republic_of_China ,  Nie_Haisheng  birthDate  1964-10-13 ,  Nie_Haisheng  occupation  Fighter_pilot   Output:   Q: How do I change the color of a specific character in a string in Python? I have a string like this:  my_string = "Hello World!"  And I want to change the color of the letter 'o' in the word 'World' to green.  How can I do this in Python?  A: To change the color of a specific character in a string in Python, you need to use terminal escape sequences and output the result to a terminal supporting ANSI/VT100 color codes. Here is an example using the termcolor library:  from termcolor import cprint  my_string = "Hello World!"  change_char = 'o'  change_index = my_string.find('World')  new_string = my_string[0:change_index] + '\033[32m' + change_char + '\033[0m' + my_string[change_index+5:]  cprint(new_string)  In this example, we use the termcolor library to print colored text. We find the index of the substring 'World' in the original string, then create a new string by replacing the character we want to change with the ANSI escape sequence for green text, followed by the character, followed by the reset sequence. Finally, we use the cprint function from the termcolor library to print the

Input:  Super_Capers  starring  Adam_West ,  Super_Capers  distributor  Roadside_Attractions ,  Super_Capers  distributor  Lionsgate   Output:   When my children were young, I read them stories every night before they went to sleep. We had our favorites, but there was one book that we returned to over and over again. It was called "The Little Engine That Could" by Watty Piper.  The story is about a little engine who has to pull a train full of toys up a steep mountain. The bigger engines won't do it because it's too hard, but the little engine steps up to the challenge. As she chugs along, she repeats to herself, "I think I can, I think I can." Eventually, she makes it to the top and delivers the toys to the children waiting below.  This story teaches us that we can accomplish anything if we believe in ourselves and never give up. No matter how difficult the task may seem, with determination and perseverance, we can always overcome obstacles and achieve our goals. This tale continues to inspire people of all ages, reminding us to have faith in our abilities and keep pushing forward.

I want to create a generic function which takes two lists as input, one list will have strings and another list will have integers.  The function should compare each element of the first list with each element of the second list and return the index of the match.  Example:  list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]  list2 = [1, 2, 3]  function(list1, list2) #should return -1 because there is no match  list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]  list2 = [1, 2, 3, "a"]  function(list1, list2) #should return 3 because 'a' is present at index 3 in list2  A: You can use itertools.zip_longest to zip the two lists together, checking if the value exists in the other list using set intersection, and returning the index of the first True value:  from itertools import zip_longest  def find_match(lst1, lst2):      for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip_longest(lst1, lst2, fillvalue=None)):          if x is not None and set([x]).intersection(lst2):              return

I am trying to make a program that calculates the sum of all the digits in a number entered by the user. The condition is that the number should be greater than 999 and less than 9999. How can I do this using a for loop?

Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after having been chased down by Monte, who survived long enough to whisper the news before he died. Mildred protests that he is reunited with his wife Idyna Pierce. In flashback, Mildred recalls her life and relationship with Bert. Mildred and working-class Bert have contemptuous divorce lawyers and a bitter court case over alimony and custody of their two daughters, Veda and Katy. Mildred's selfish, ambitious behavior throughout the legal proceedings turns her once-loving husband into an angry, vindictive man. Mildred eventually wins sole custody of the children, but has to pay Bert generous alimony. After serving several years of his prison sentence, Bert seizes opportunities to interrupt Mildred's second marriage to Monte, insinuing that she is a frequently unfaithful to him.

Academic journal article Journal of Marriage and Family  The Influence of Parental Divorce on Children's Educational Attainment: The Role of Parenting Behaviors  By Hetherington, E. Mavis; Cox, Melissa; Cox, Matthew  Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this study investigates the mechanisms through which parental divorce influences children's educational attainment. We examine the role of parenting behaviors-parental monitoring, parental involvement, and parental support-as mediators of the association between parental divorce and children's educational attainment. Our findings indicate that parenting behaviors play a significant role in explaining the relationship between parental divorce and children's educational attainment. More specifically, we found that the negative effects of parental divorce on children's educational attainment were largely accounted for by lower levels of parental monitoring, parental involvement, and parental support. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at promoting positive parenting behaviors among divorced parents could potentially offset some of the negative effects of divorce on children's educational attainment.  Parental divorce has become increasingly common

A: I was really excited to try this place out because I had heard so many great things about it. Unfortunately, my experience was very disappointing.   My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 7:30 PM. There was no wait, which was nice. We were seated immediately. It took our server about 15 minutes to come over and take our drink order. Then another 10 minutes to get our drinks. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. Our food took about 45 minutes to come out. When it finally did, it wasn't even hot. It was lukewarm at best. The portions were small for the price. For $12, I expected a little more food. The taste was just okay. Nothing spectacular.   Overall, the service was terrible and the food was mediocre. I probably won't be going back.  Q: negative  A: Horrible customer service. I called to ask if they carry a certain product and the lady who answered the phone said she didn't know and put me on hold. She came back on the phone and told me they don't carry it and hung up on me. No "sorry", no "thank you", nothing.  Problem: What would be

Review: This book was recommended to me by my son-in-law and I'm glad I took his advice and read it. It was very well written and I could hardly put it down. Highly recommend it. Answer:  A: Positive  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Good for beginners Review: I bought this series to help me re-learn latin grammar so I could review for the SAT II latin subject test. I made a mistake in that I thought a 'review' meant the same as 'beginner', so keep that in mind when you read my review. So, for a beginner, this is a good grammar book. I did learn some things about latin grammar that I didn't know before. However, as I am no longer a beginner, it became redundant after the first few chapters.In conclusion, this is a great beginner's grammar book, but for people looking to review, look elsewhere. Answer:  A: Positive  Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Not what I expected Review: The description states this is a stainless steel watch, the model number on the back says SS, but the watch is not stainless steel

Academic journal article Journal of Marriage and Family  Marital Quality and Divorce among Black and White Couples  By Amato, Paul R.; Booth, Amber L.; Johnson, Daniel S.  The association between marital quality and divorce has been well documented (e.g., Amato, 1995, 1996; Amato & Booth, 2000; Booth & Amato, 2001). In this article, we examine whether this association varies by race/ethnicity using data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), a nationally representative sample of U.S. families. We focus on black and white couples because they represent the two largest racial/ethnic groups in the United States and have distinct patterns of marriage and divorce (Amato & Booth, 2000; Bumpass & Sweet, 1999; Cherlin, 1992; McLanahan & Sandefur, 1994).  Previous research has shown that black couples report lower levels of marital quality than white couples (Amato & Booth, 2000

As our church has been going through a time of transition, there have been many discussions about what we need to do to move forward. We have been looking at our strengths and weaknesses, trying to figure out how to improve and grow.  One of the things that has become clear is that we need to focus more on evangelism. This is something that we have talked about before, but now it seems more important than ever. We need to reach out to our community and share the love of Jesus with those around us.  But as we talk about this, I can't help but wonder if we are focusing on the right things. Are we putting enough emphasis on discipleship? Discipleship is not just about bringing people into the church, but about nurturing and growing them in their faith. It's about helping them to become more like Christ.  We need to make sure that we are not just concentrating on numbers, but on the spiritual health of each individual. We need to invest time and energy into teaching, mentoring, and encouraging those who are already part of our church family.  Discipleship is essential for the growth and health of the church. When we focus on discipleship, we are building a strong foundation for our church. We are creating a community of believers who are deeply rooted in their faith and equipped to carry out the mission of

Input:  Acharya_Institute_of_Technology  city  Bangalore ,  Acharya_Institute_of_Technology  country  "India"   Output:   Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and West Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants. The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar's adopted heir Augustus established the Empire as a one-man rule with himself as Emperor after defeating Caesar's killers in the Civil War of 43 to 31 BC, bringing to an end the Republican period.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate and independent Imperial court, co-existent with but both independent of and parallel to that administering the Eastern Roman Empire (or Byzantine Empire).

The apostrophe indicates possession when used with singular nouns. For example, "It's book" shows that the book belongs to 'it'. On the other hand, 'its' is used for both singular and plural nouns to indicate possession. For example, "The dog ran with its ball". In this case, 'its' is used for the singular noun 'dog'.

Academic journal article Studies in Romanticism  Coleridge's Biographical Criticism: The Case of Milton  By Shapiro, Alan  Samuel Taylor Coleridge's biography of John Milton (1817) has been recognized as a landmark in the history of literary biography, but its status as a work of literary criticism has received less attention. This essay examines Coleridge's reading of Milton's poetry in his biography, focusing on how Coleridge's biographical method is used to elucidate Milton's poetic art. In particular, this essay shows how Coleridge's biographical account of Milton's life and thought serves to enhance our understanding of Paradise Lost. Coleridge's biography demonstrates how the author's life can be used to illuminate the meaning of a literary text, but it also reveals some of the limitations of this approach.  When Samuel Taylor Coleridge published his Biographia Literaria in 1817, he included a lengthy appendix titled "Specimens of the Table-Talk of the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge." Among the entries in this append

However, when our son picked the toy up to move it to another part of the room, the track piece with the loose connector fell off, and the connector bent down into the bottom of the toy. It was impossible to straighten the connector so we could use it again, so the toy is worthless to us now. Answer:  A:  output: No  Is this product review positive?

Input:  Bedford_Aerodrome  location  Thurleigh   Output:   The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance of firms listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Specifically, the study examined the impact of CSR on return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS) of firms listed on the NSE. The study adopted secondary data sourced from the annual reports and accounts of selected firms for the period 2009-2013. The study used descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis to analyse the data. The findings revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between CSR and ROA, ROE and EPS. The study therefore concluded that CSR has a positive impact on the financial performance of firms listed on the NSE. The study recommends that companies should incorporate CSR into their business strategies as a means of improving their financial performance.

Actually, the ice age, which began about two million years ago, has been through several periods of melting and refreezing. The most recent period of melting lasted from about 11,000 B.C. to 7,000 B.C. In other words, it lasted for 4,000 years. We call this period the last Ice Age. Within the last Ice Age, the sea level rose about 300 feet. However, sea level did not rise at a constant rate. It is true that glaciers are a major form of ice on the earth, but they cover only 10 percent of its total surface; the rest is land ice and polar ice caps . While the amount of glaciers decreases, the amount of land ice from Greenland and the polar regions actually increases. Scientific research shows that even if all the glaciers and polar ice caps melt completely, the sea level will rise only about 75 feet.  Most of the previous Ice Ages lasted about 1 million years, but the last one lasted only 4,000 years. The longest recorded

Group A started weight lifting for 3 months, while Group B, did running exercises. Both groups continued their normal training regimes as well.  But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscles are contracted against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it.  What is an answer for this question: Which group's cardiac muscle will not be more efficient?  Answer:  Group A

Hillary Clinton’s health: What we know, what we don’t  Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday afternoon, according to her physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack. Her campaign said she left a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony early because she felt overheated and dehydrated.  On Sunday, Clinton abruptly left the 9/11 Ground Zero ceremony in New York City after appearing unsteady on her feet. She was later photographed being helped into a van by her security detail.  Bardack released a letter Monday saying Clinton had been experiencing a "non-contagious" cough related to allergies and congestion. The former secretary of state was "recently diagnosed with pneumonia," Bardack wrote.  Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacs of one or both lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms include fever, chills, cough with phlegm production, shortness of breath, chest pain when breathing or coughing

The men were part of a group of five gunmen who stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in July 2016.  They took more than 30 people hostage, killing 20 foreigners, one police officer and a local waiter before they were killed by commandos.  The attack was claimed by Islamic State (IS), but Bangladesh authorities blamed home-grown militants.  In September last year, a special tribunal sentenced six others to death over the same attack.  On Monday, the tribunal found the two men guilty of waging war against the state, murder, terrorism and other charges. They have the right to appeal against the verdict.  The attack shocked Bangladesh and came amid a spate of killings targeting secular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists, members of religious minorities and police.  Most of the attacks were claimed by IS or al-Qaeda affiliates, but the government insisted that home-grown militant group Jamaat

I had never been to the United States before, let alone NYC, so my expectations were very high. I remember stepping off the plane at JFK airport and seeing the hustle and bustle of people rushing to catch their connecting flights, and feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation.  My first few days in the city were spent exploring the iconic landmarks such as Times Square, Central Park, and the Statue of Liberty. The towering skyscrapers, bright neon lights, and the symphony of honking horns and chatter filled me with awe. The energy of the city was contagious, and I found myself walking faster just to keep up with the pace.  One of the highlights of my trip was taking a stroll through Central Park. The lush greenery and tranquil atmosphere provided a much-needed respite from the chaos of the city. I remember watching street performers, listening to live music, and observing locals and tourists alike enjoying picnics and leisurely walks.  Another memorable experience was visiting the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. It was a somber and emotional visit, but one that left a profound impact on me.

She was 15 months then. She didnt really play with it much because the shapes will not fit through the holes. The monkey does hit the top of the drum and make it play the music but I guess since the shapes dont go through, she doesnt play with it. I thought she just wasnt old enough so I put it away and waited till she was almost 2. She is now 23 months and still doesnt play with it. She stacks the shapes but cant understand why they wont go through. I again think maybe she isnt old enough so I let my friends 3 year old son play with

By John Manganaro  According to Fidelity's latest Retirement Study, which surveyed more than 2,000 Americans aged 25 and older with at least $100,000 in investable assets, 37% of respondents said they were very confident about their ability to have enough money for a comfortable retirement, up from 31% in 2013. The percentage of those who said they were somewhat confident also increased, from 42% to 46%.  In contrast, the percentage of those who said they were not very confident decreased from 22% to 16%, while the percentage of those who said they were not at all confident decreased from 5% to 1%.  "Americans are feeling better about their financial futures, but there is still work to be done," says Kevin Barry, president of workplace investing at Fidelity Investments.

The samples were prepared by hot pressing method using SiC and MgO powders with different weight ratios. The results showed that the addition of MgO into SiC matrix increases the thermal conductivity of the composites due to the high thermal conductivity of MgO. The maximum thermal conductivity was obtained for the composite with 20 wt% MgO (K = 125 W/m·K) and then

A further eight people were still missing and presumed dead on the remote island after the Dec. 9 eruption.  "Police can confirm one more person has died following the Whakaari/White Island eruption, taking the number of fatalities to 16," New Zealand police said in a statement.  "Our thoughts are with their family and friends at this incredibly difficult time."  The majority of those killed in the eruption were Australian tourists visiting the island, which sits around 50 km (30 miles) off the main North Island coast.  The bodies of seven of the eight people still missing have been located by drones and helicopters, but rescuers have been unable to recover them due to continuing hazardous conditions.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier this week she was "very open" to sending a military team to recover the bodies, but only if it was safe to do so.  "We want to make sure we get this right," she

Sometimes, we would even dress up in costumes to make the experience more realistic. Those were simple, carefree moments that brought us joy and laughter. As we grew older, our interests changed, but I still cherish those memories of playing animal games with my brother. It reminds me of the power of imagination and the importance of enjoying the little things in life.

Truvada is the first drug approved by the FDA for this indication, which involves taking antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV infection in people who do not have the virus but are at high risk of acquiring it through sexual activity.  The approval was based on data from two Phase III clinical trials, iPrEx and Partners PrEP, which showed that daily use of Truvada reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection by approximately 44% and 75%, respectively.  In the iPrEX study, men who have sex with men and transgender individuals were randomized to receive either Truvada or placebo once daily. At week 48, the incidence of HIV-1 infection was significantly lower in the Truvada group than in the placebo group (1.3% vs. 3.4%).  In the Partners PrEP study, heterosexual serodiscordant couples (in which one partner is HIV-positive and the other is HIV-negative) were randomized to receive either Tru

Input:  Super_Capers  gross  30955.0   Output:   The first thing I did when I heard about this book was to check out the author's blog. It is one of the best blogs I have come across in recent times. Funny, quirky, interesting, thought-provoking and so much more, it made me want to read the book even more.  In fact, I finished reading the book in one go, unable to put it down until I reached the end.  The story revolves around three friends - Arjun, Rishi and Nikhil. They were childhood friends who drifted apart after they went to different colleges. Arjun and Nikhil became successful businessmen while Rishi struggled to make ends meet as a stand-up comedian. One day, Arjun invites his two friends for a weekend getaway at his bungalow in Goa. This is where the fun begins.  Each character is well etched out and has their own unique personality. Their conversations are full of humour and sarcasm. There are many instances where I found myself laughing out loud.  The plot is engaging and keeps you hooked till the very end. The narration is simple and easy to follow.  Overall, this is a light-hearted, enjoyable read which will certainly leave you with a smile on your face. Highly recommended.

I want to make it also available at www.example2.com.  How can I do this?  A: You need to configure your DNS server to map example2.com to the same IP address as example.com.  You could also use CNAME records to map example2.com to example.com.  If you don't have access to your DNS server, you will need to contact your hosting provider.  A: You need to change the DNS settings for example2.com to point to the same IP address as example.com.  This can usually be done through your domain registrar (the company you registered example2.com with) or by contacting your web host if they manage your DNS settings.  You can either create an A record for example2.com with the same IP address as the A record for example.com, or you can create a CNAME record for example2.com that points to example.com.  After making these changes, it can take up to 48 hours for the changes to propagate across the internet.

The ICC Cybersecurity Guide for Management of Cyber Risks in Supply Chains provides practical advice for companies on how to better identify, assess, prevent, respond to and recover from cyber incidents across their value chains.  "Supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, which can have devastating consequences," said ICC Secretary General, John W.H. Denton AO. "Businesses need to take proactive steps to minimise these risks, and this new guide will help them do just that."  The publication comes at a time when organisations worldwide are grappling with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. According to a recent study by Accenture, almost half (47%) of executives report that their company suffered at least one supply chain disruption due to a cyber attack over the past three years.  The ICC guide is designed to assist companies of all sizes and in all sectors to better manage cyber risks in their supply chains. It includes checklists, case studies and best practice recommendations on topics such as governance, risk management, incident

I want to add a custom attribute to all elements in a HTML page using JavaScript.  Is there a way to do this?  A: Yes, you can iterate through all the elements in the document and add the attribute to each one. Here is an example using querySelectorAll and forEach:  document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {    el.customAttribute = 'customValue';  });  console.log(document.body.outerHTML);  <div></div>  <p></p>  <span></span>  However, note that this will create a property called customAttribute on each element, not an actual attribute on the element itself. To add an actual attribute, you can use setAttribute():  document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {    el.setAttribute('custom-attribute', 'customValue');  });  console.log(document.body.outerHTML);  <div></div>  <p></p>  <span></span>  A: There are many ways to do this. One of them is by using getElementsByTagName() method.  let elements = document.getElementsByTagName("*");  for (let i = 0; i

It was a rubbish bin. The man reached over to touch it. As his hand moved over the top, the lid flew up. A large amount of food _ from the bin onto the ground. The old man sat down and cried. His tears fell onto the food. The food began to change. It became a large steaming bowl of porridge . The old man could not believe what had happened, he ate the porridge, packed the rest up and left. As he walked around the city to eat later that night, a strange thing happened. Every rubbish bin he went to, the same thing happened. The lid flew up, and inside there was a meal waiting for him. The meal kept the old man going as he slept by garbage bins. There were people from the city watching. Every time, rubbish flew out and a meal came in. This had never been seen before. The news spread around the world. People came to see what was happening. They found out that the old man was once a great chef. His restaurant took in all the poor. This continued until the old man passed away

Input:  Punk_blues  stylisticOrigin  Garage_rock   Output:   Q: How do I use grep to search for a string within a file if the string is stored in a variable? I am trying to write a bash script that searches for a specific string within a file. The string is stored in a variable. However, when I try to use grep with the variable, it doesn't seem to work. Here is an example:  #!/bin/bash  string="abc"  file="/path/to/file"  if grep -q "$string" "$file"; then      echo "String found"  else      echo "String not found"  fi  When I run this script, it always outputs "String not found", even if the string "abc" is present in the file. What am I doing wrong here?  A: It looks like your script should work as long as the variable $string does indeed contain the string abc.  Here are few things to check:  *  *Make sure there are no invisible characters (e.g. spaces) at the beginning or end of the string variable. You can use the printf command to print the value of the variable and inspect it visually:  printf '%s\n' "$string"  *Verify that the file specified in the $file variable actually exists and is readable.  *Check if there are any line breaks or new

Input:  English_Without_Tears  producer  Anatole_de_Grunwald ,  English_Without_Tears  writer  Anatole_de_Grunwald ,  English_Without_Tears  cinematography  Bernard_Knowles   Output:   Q: How to create multiple instances of a class? I am trying to create multiple instances of a class in order to use them in a for loop.  Here is my code:  class MyClass:      def __init__(self, value):          self.value = value      def print_value(self):          print(self.value)  list_of_values = [1, 2, 3]  for value in list_of_values:      instance = MyClass(value)      instance.print_value()  The problem is that when I run this code, it only prints the last value of the list (in this case, 3).  How can I create multiple instances of MyClass so that each instance has its own value and I can print all the values in the for loop?  A: The issue here is that you're creating a new instance of MyClass in every iteration of the loop, but you're only calling the print_value method on the last instance created.  To fix this, you could move the call to print_value inside the loop:  class MyClass:      def __init__(self, value):          self.value = value      def print_value(self):          print(self.value)  list_of_values = [1, 2, 3]

Database A is the main database and its data needs to be replicated to Database B. At the same time, changes made in Database B need to be propagated back to Database A. In other words, both databases need to stay in sync at all times.  How can I achieve this two-way synchronization between these two databases?  A: There are several ways to do this, depending on your requirements.  *  *SQL Server Replication - This is built-in feature in SQL Server that allows you to create publication and subscriptions between two databases. You can configure it for two-way synchronization.  *Change Data Capture (CDC) - You can use CDC to capture changes in one database and then apply those changes to the other database using a job or trigger.  *Transactional Replication with Snapshot Agent - You can use transactional replication to push changes from one database to another. But instead of using log reader agent, you can use snapshot agent to take a snapshot of the publishing database and apply it to the subscriber database. Then you can use CDC or triggers to capture changes in the subscriber database and push them back to the publisher database.

Over the years, they've worked together in various settings, including their Sound Prints quintet with Lawrence Fields on piano, Linda Oh on bass, and Joey Baron on drums. This new release showcases the duo in its purest form, without accompaniment.  The album is comprised of ten original compositions, five by each musician. The title track, composed by Lovano, sets the tone for the session. It's a slow-burning ballad that builds tension through the interplay between the two horns. Lovano's lyricism is at the forefront, as he delivers his lines with a bluesy inflection. Douglas follows suit, matching the altoist's intensity with his own brand of melodic inventiveness.  Douglas's "Farmer's Trust" is a medium-tempo burner that highlights the rhythmic interplay between the two horns. They play off one another, exchanging ideas in rapid succession. Lovano's solo is especially

The United States has been under pressure from its European allies to take a more active role in mediating between the two sides, who have been at loggerheads over whether the Palestinians should seek recognition as a nonmember state at the United Nations General Assembly later this month.  On Monday, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said his country would vote in favor of the Palestinian bid if it came up for a vote in the General Assembly. “This is a step forward,” Mr. Fabius told France Inter radio. “It’s not independence, but it’s a step forward.”  Israel has warned that such a move would jeopardize peace negotiations, which resumed in late September after a three-year hiatus. On Monday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeated his demand that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state.  “We want peace, but we will not make peace at any price,” Mr. Netanyahu said during a visit to the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. “Peace must be based on

The employee table has columns emp_id, name, designation, and salary table has columns emp_id, basic_salary, da, hra, and total_salary.  I want to display all the data from the employee table along with their respective basic_salary, da, hra, and total_salary from the salary table.  How can I do this using MySQL?  A: You can use JOIN statement to combine data from multiple tables.  SELECT e.emp_id, e.name, e.designation, s.basic_salary, s.da, s.hra, s.total_salary  FROM employee AS e  INNER JOIN salary AS s  ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id  This query will join the employee table (aliased as e) with the salary table (aliased as s) using the common emp_id column. The result will contain all the columns specified in the SELECT clause for each row where there is a matching emp_id between the two tables.

Resolve: -3  Question: Solve the equation   -15 = 3*b + 6 for b.  Step-by-step answer:   To solve the equation -15 = 3*b + 6 for b, follow these steps:  1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:     -15 - 6 = 3*b + 6 - 6     -21 = 3*b  2. Divide both sides by 3 to isolate b:     -21 / 3 = 3*b / 3     -7 = b  So, the value of b is -7.The answer is: -7

That book is terrific - I don't think I could recommend it more highly. When I found out that the same author had written a book about Braques, an artist I love, I didn't hesitate.What a disappointment. This book reads very much like a college textbook, and not a particularly inspiring one at that. A good editor should have helped the author craft the information in a more engaging way.Nevertheless, I persevered and have learned some interesting and new facts about Braque. I would say that the book is worth reading if you are an admirer of Braque, but only if you are really interested in the very nitty gritty details of Braque's life and work.Don't expect any rich visual inspiration if you buy this book. Answer:  Answer:  Negative

In a letter to Conservative MPs, May said she was "determined to deliver Brexit" but warned that leaving the European Union without a deal was "not the right outcome for our country", Xinhua news agency reported.  The prime minister urged lawmakers to back her withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House of Commons for a third meaningful vote later this week.

Instead, it provides information about the publication of MPEG-4 standards. To validate an answer, it should specifically explain what an MPEG42 file is, if such a file type exists. Since the suggested answer does not do this, it should not be validated.

The research, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, shows that adolescents who consume energy drinks are also more likely to engage in other risky behaviors, such as hazardous drinking, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, and illicit drug use.  "Energy drinks have become increasingly popular among adolescents over the past decade," said lead investigator Dr. Brian A. Primack, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and director of the Center for Research on Media, Technology, and Health at UPMC.  "This study suggests that energy drinks may serve as a gateway to other unhealthy behaviors."  For the study, researchers analyzed data from the 2011-2014 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, which included self-reported information from more than 75,000 adolescents in grades 9 through 12 across the United States.  Overall, 38 percent of adolescents reported consuming energy drinks in the past month. Adolesc

A: My friends and I went here for dinner last night because we were staying at the hotel and didn't want to go too far. The place was pretty empty when we got there around 8:30pm but filled up by the time we left around 10pm.   This place is definitely overpriced for the quality of food you get. We ordered the meatball appetizer which was good but nothing special. For our entrees, I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and my friend ordered the lasagna. Both were very bland and just tasted like they came straight out of a can. The portion sizes were also very small for the price we paid.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive though. She brought us some complimentary tiramisu after we told her how disappointed we were with our entrees. The tiramisu was actually really good.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you have a coupon or something.  Q: negative  A: Worst experience ever! I will never come back here again. First off, the service was horrible. They took forever to take our order and even longer to bring out our food. Secondly, the food was disgusting. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. The chicken fried

Write a script to solve this quadratic equation.  A: To solve the equation -13*m + 11*m = 0 for m, we can combine the terms on the left side:  (-13 + 11) * m = 0  -2 * m = 0  Now, to isolate m, we divide both sides of the equation by -2:  (-2 * m) / (-2) = 0 / (-2)  m = 0  So, the solution to the quadratic equation is m = 0.

The prosecutors raided the group's headquarters in Samseong-dong, southern Seoul, last month and found evidence that Shin ordered his subordinates to create a slush fund totaling 40 billion won ($35.2 million) between 2008 and 2015. They also found that Shin used part of the money to buy artworks worth 20 billion won.  The case came to light when the National Tax Service launched an investigation into Lotte Holdings Co., the group's de facto holding company, in 2015. The tax office asked the prosecutors to look into suspicions that Lotte Holdings set up a slush fund using its funds. The prosecutors have been investigating the case for over a year.  Shin has denied all allegations against him. But the prosecutors say they have solid evidence proving otherwise. According to the prosecutors, Shin ordered his subordinates to use the company's funds to buy shares of Lotte Holdings at inflated prices. Then he sold the shares back to the company at the market price. The difference between the two

The Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid sports sedan is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated vehicles of 2011, and now we know just how much it will cost when it finally goes on sale later next year. According to Automotive News (subscription required), Henrik Fisker revealed at the Los Angeles Auto Show that the base price for the Karma will be $96,000.  That's more than double the starting price of the Tesla Roadster, which is currently the most expensive electric car on the market. However, unlike the Tesla Roadster, the Karma is a plug-in hybrid rather than a pure electric vehicle.  The Karma features a range-extending 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine developed by General Motors mated to a pair of electric motors--one for each axle--and lithium-ion battery packs capable of delivering up to 50 miles of zero-emission driving. When the batteries run low, the gasoline engine kicks in to recharge the batteries, effectively allowing the Karma to travel hundreds of additional miles

Input:  University_of_Burgundy  staff  2900 ,  University_of_Burgundy  numberOfDoctoralStudents  1299 ,  University_of_Burgundy  campus  Dijon ,  University_of_Burgundy  city  Dijon   Output:   It was a beautiful sunny day when we arrived at the Belle Isle Conservatory in Detroit. The conservatory is located in the middle of the Belle Isle Park, which is a large island park in the Detroit River between Michigan and Ontario. We were excited to explore this beautiful greenhouse filled with exotic plants and flowers.  Upon entering the conservatory, we were greeted by the warm and humid air, accompanied by the sounds of cascading waterfalls and chirping birds. The first section we visited was the Tropical House, where lush greenery and vibrant flowers surrounded us. We marveled at the towering palm trees, the colorful hibiscus flowers, and the delicate orchids hanging from the ceiling.  Next, we wandered through the Desert House, which showcased a variety of cacti and succulents adapted to survive in arid conditions. The stark contrast between this section and the Tropical House was fascinating. We learned about the unique characteristics of these desert plants, such as their ability to store water in their stems and leaves.  The conservatory also had a seasonal display area, which was currently showcasing a stunning collection of bonsai trees. The intricate art of bonsai involves shaping and pruning small trees to create miniature landscapes. We admired the delicate branches, the moss-covered rocks,

The food is delicious and the staff is always friendly. It's great for a quick lunch or a more leisurely dinner with friends. They also have a great selection of beer and wine. Highly recommended!  Q: negative  A: This place has really gone downhill. My husband and I used to eat here all the time but we haven't been back in over a year. We decided to give it another try tonight. The service was terrible. Our waitress was rude and never checked up on us. She brought out my husbands meal before mine even though we ordered at the same time. When my food finally came out it was cold and bland. Will not be going back.  Problem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) review?  Answer: First off, I want to preface this by saying that I don't usually write reviews. However, after experiencing the level of customer service that I did today, I felt compelled to share my experience.   As I walked into the store, I was greeted by one of the sales people. I told her that I was looking for a pair of running shoes. She then asked me what type of runner I was. I told her that I was a

Article: When William Stidger taught at Boston University, he once thought about the people he hadn't thanked in his life. They taught him, encouraged him or cared a lot about him. One was a teacher. She once taught William geography, and William loved geography all his life because of her. But when William went to college, he lost track of her. Later William tried to find this woman, but he couldn't. William didn't know where she worked, and she didn't know where William worked. Though he didn't find her, he didn't give up. One night, he dreamed about her. She was very old, and William was much older too. When he woke up, he wrote a letter and put it in the mailbox without stamps. He also wrote, "Please don't pay the postage." Later William received a letter with these words: "Your geography teacher is dead. Before she passed away, I visited her and told her about your letter. The last thing I did was to put your unstamped letter into her hands." "Unstamped letter" reminds me that it's always late to say thanks to the person that helped us. My dear friends, if we have love, let's send it now, or it will be too late. Question: What can we learn from the passage

Input:  Darinka_Dentcheva  citizenship  United_States ,  United_States  areaTotal  9833520000000.0 ,  Darinka_Dentcheva  influencedBy  Andrzej_Piotr_Ruszczyński ,  Darinka_Dentcheva  birthDate  1958-01-01   Output:   When I was growing up, my mom always said, "Be careful what you wish for." She meant that sometimes we don't know what's best for us, so we shouldn't ask for things without thinking them through. But there's another kind of wishing that can be really powerful – wishing for something good to happen to someone else. This kind of wishing is all about spreading love and positivity, and it can make a big difference in someone's life.  When we wish good things for others, we're sending out positive energy into the world. This energy can have a ripple effect, touching the lives of many people. For example, let's say you wish for your friend to feel happy and confident. As they start to feel those positive emotions, they'll likely treat others with kindness and warmth. That kindness can then be passed on to even more people, creating a chain reaction of goodness.  Wishing for others also helps us cultivate empathy and compassion. When we think about what someone else needs or desires, we connect with their experiences and feelings. This deeper understanding can strengthen our relationships and create a sense of community.  There are many ways to wish for good things for others. You can send a heartfelt message, offer a helping hand, or simply hold positive thoughts for someone in your mind. Sometimes just letting someone know that you're thinking of them and wishing

Input:  Lionsgate  keyPerson  Jon_Feltheimer   Output:   Problem: Write a negative (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) yelp review.  A: This place is very overpriced for what you get. I went here for lunch today with a friend and we both ordered the $12 burger and fries combo. The burger was small and had no flavor. The fries were soggy and undercooked. We also ordered a side of onion rings which were good but nothing special. The service was mediocre at best. Our waitress seemed disinterested and didn't check on us often enough. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and there are much better options out there for burgers and fries.  Q: positive  A: My first visit to Fry's Electronics was back in 2003 when I lived in California.  It was amazing how huge the store was and how many electronic products they carried.  When I moved to Vegas, I was excited to know that there was a Fry's here too.  They have all kinds of electronics, computer parts, software, video games, cameras, etc.  There's so much to look at that you can spend hours browsing through their inventory.  Their prices are reasonable and they usually have sales on certain items.  Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for something electronic.  Problem: What

A: I love this place! The food is always great and the service is wonderful. This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch when I am downtown.  Q: negative  A: We went here because we were staying at the hotel and wanted something quick and close. It was pretty empty when we got there so we figured it wouldn't be too bad. WRONG! The service was slow and the food was just ok. My husband ordered a steak and it was overcooked and dry. I had the fish tacos and they were good but nothing special.

Answer: Went here last night with some friends after work. Hadn't been here in a couple of years and wasn't really impressed then. However, things have changed. They now have a full bar, which isn't very big, but does the job. They also have a lot more seating inside and out. The patio area has a fire pit and heat lamps for those chilly evenings.  The beer selection is decent and they have a variety of flavored vodkas if that's your thing.

This innovative heating panel combines both radiant and convective heat into one single unit.  Radiant heat warms objects and people directly, whereas convective heat warms the air which then heats the objects and people within the room.  The Dual-Wave™ Infrared Heating Panel can be used in place of traditional radiators for whole room heating, or as a supplementary heat source to reduce energy consumption.  The Dual-Wave™ Infrared Heating Panel uses carbon fibre heating elements to produce long wave infrared heat. This type of heat is similar to the warmth we feel from the sun, gently warming objects and people without drying out the air.  A built-in fan blows warm air through ventilation slots along the bottom edge of the panel, distributing the heat evenly throughout the room.  The Dual-Wave™ Infrared Heating Panel has a sleek, minimalist design with a choice of finishes to suit any interior. It is available in two sizes (600mm x 600mm and 600mm x 1200mm) and three colours (white, silver and anthracite).  The Dual-Wave™ Infrared Heating Panel comes complete with a program

The Covid-19 vaccine will not end the pandemic completely, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Tuesday.  Speaking at a media briefing, Swaminathan also said that there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccines will prevent transmission of the virus.  "Vaccines will allow us to decrease mortality and severe disease, but they will not take us to zero transmission," Swaminathan said.  She further said that masks, hand hygiene, physical distancing and avoiding crowded spaces will continue to be important even after the vaccination drive begins.  "We need to keep doing all these things because we don't know yet whether the vaccines will prevent transmission or not," she added.

Some do it to lose weight, some do it for health reasons, and some do it because they want to feel better about themselves. Whatever the reason may be, going on a diet can be a difficult and challenging experience. However, with the right mindset and approach, it can also be a rewarding one.  One of the most important things to remember when starting a diet is to set realistic goals. It's important to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and how long it will take to get there. This will help you stay motivated and focused throughout the process.  Another crucial aspect of dieting is finding a diet plan that works for you. Not all diets are created equal, and what works for one person might not work for another. Take the time to research different types of diets and find one that aligns with your lifestyle, food preferences, and nutritional needs.  It's also essential to make sure that your diet plan is balanced and includes all the essential nutrients your body needs to function properly. This means consuming enough protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. A good way to ensure this is by incorporating a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods into your meals.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global sales of electric cars increased by 41% in 2020 despite the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this article, we'll take a closer look at the current state of electric vehicles and what the future might hold for this growing industry.  What is an Electric Vehicle?  An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses electricity as its primary source of power. There are three main types of EVs: battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  BEVs, also known as all-electric vehicles, are powered solely by electricity stored in rechargeable batteries. PHEVs have both an internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric motor powered by a rechargeable battery. HEVs also have an ICE and an electric motor, but the battery is charged through regenerative braking rather than being plugged into an external power source.  Current State of Electric Vehicles

Input:  Alan_Shepard  deathPlace  California ,  Alan_Shepard  almaMater  "NWC, M.A. 1957"   Output:   Q: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Very disappointed Review: I bought this for my two year old son thinking it would be a great educational toy for him. It does teach numbers and letters but it takes about 30 seconds to a minute for it to recognize the letter/number if you put it in the top. It makes a lot of noise before it finally figures out what letter or number you are trying to insert. We found that if you just push the letter/number through the side hole it works fine but I don't think the makers of the toy intended it to be that way. Also, the sides do not open easily to put the letters and numbers in through the side. My son can't do it which leaves me having to do it for him all the time. Another thing is that he soon got bored with it and the light bulb is out in the number 8. I had thrown out the box and receipt so I can't return it. I will not be buying any other Leap Frog toys as I am afraid of having problems like this again.

Biden took the oath of office just before noon from Chief Justice John Roberts on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, where two weeks ago a violent mob laid siege under the inspiration of the outgoing president, Donald Trump, who refused to accept his loss.  In his first remarks as president, Biden painted a unifying portrait of a nation that he said was always able to overcome crises when its people set aside their differences.  He pledged to be a president for all Americans, "no matter your skin color, your place of worship, or your political hierarchy."  "This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward," Biden said. "And I call on the Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as leaders of both parties, to join forces and find a way to agree to give everyone in this nation who wants it the shot by the

It's hard to argue with that sentiment. As long as there are people who want to engage in certain behaviors, whether it's sex work, drug use, or something else, there will always be a demand for those activities. Attempting to ban or criminalize these behaviors rarely results in their complete eradication; instead, it often leads to negative consequences such as pushing these activities into the shadows, where they can become more dangerous and exploitative.  A more effective approach might be to focus on harm reduction and regulation. This means creating legal frameworks and social norms that allow individuals to engage in these behaviors in a safer and more controlled manner. For example, in the case of sex work, decriminalization can lead to improved health and safety outcomes for sex workers by allowing them to report abuse and access support services without fear of prosecution. Similarly, evidence suggests that regulated drug consumption sites can reduce overdose deaths, HIV transmission, and other harms associated with drug use.  Regulation doesn't necessarily mean endorsing or encouraging these behaviors. Instead, it acknowledges that they exist and aims to mitigate the risks and negative consequences associated with them. By doing so, we can better protect the rights

Osinbajo was in Ekiti on Wednesday to commission some projects executed by Kayode Fayemi, governor of the state.  The vice president had said the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government will continue to support developmental projects in the state.  Reacting, Fayose described Osinbajo's visit as "too little, too late".  In a statement issued by Lere Olayinka, his media aide, the former governor said the people of Ekiti have been abandoned by the APC-led federal government since Fayemi assumed office in 2018.  "It is either Prof. Osinbajo does not know what is going on in Ekiti State or he deliberately chose to ignore the plight of the people of the state," the statement reads.

Two young American couples — Jeff and Amy, and Eric and Stacy — enjoy their vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, a German tourist, who is looking for his brother Heinrich. His last known location is an archaeological dig at a remote Mayan ruin in the jungle. They are also joined by Dimitri, Mathias's friend. The group reaches the ruins of a Mayan temple, and are confronted by Mayan villagers with guns and bows. Mathias tries to explain their purpose, but the villagers do not understand Spanish or English. When Amy unintentionally touches some vines the villagers become increasingly agitated. Dimitri approaches the villagers, hoping to appease them, but they shoot and kill him. The rest of the group flees up the steps of the ruins and hide. Eric sees the villagers carrying Dimitri's body away and takes shelter in one of the small rooms off of the main courtyard. Jeff and Amy enter the room as well and Jeff uses a piece of Dimitri's clothing to cover the ancient fresco the group discovered while exploring the ruins. Jeff and Amy begin exploring the ruins when more villagers enter the main courtyard, forcing them to flee.

It's always nice to see a well-designed cover for a book because it shows the publishers care about their product. The second thing I noticed was the author's note at the beginning of the book where he explained his inspiration for writing this book. He said he was inspired by two things: his son's love of dinosaurs and his own desire to write a novel set in prehistoric times. As a father myself, I can relate to wanting to write something that will appeal to your children.  This story is about a young boy named Toby who finds himself transported back in time to the Cretaceous period. He must learn to survive in this dangerous world filled with terrifying dinosaurs. Along the way, he meets other children who have also been transported back in time. Together they form a bond and work together to try and find a way back to their own time.  One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was the vivid descriptions of the prehistoric world. The author did a great job of making me feel like I was right there with the characters, experiencing everything they were experiencing. The action scenes were particularly well-written and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The characters were also well-developed and likable. Toby is a brave and resourceful protagonist, and I found myself root

Nightmares are common in children, particularly between the ages of 3 and 6 years. They often reflect fears and anxieties that the child is experiencing during the day. For example, a child who is scared of the dark may have nightmares about being chased by a monster.  There are several things you can do to help your child cope with nightmares. Firstly, reassure your child that the dream was not real and that they are safe. Encourage them to talk about their dream and try to understand what might have triggered it. This could involve discussing any worries or fears they have during the day.  Develop a bedtime routine that helps your child relax and wind down before going to sleep. This could include a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music. Make sure the bedroom is comfortable, dark, and quiet.  Encourage your child to express their feelings and concerns during the day through play, art, or conversation. This can help them work through any issues that may be causing nightmares.  If nightmares continue to be a frequent issue for your child, consider speaking with a mental health professional for additional guidance and support.

Finally he meets someone he can't move, or bend to his will. He then discovers there maybe a calling on his life he didn't plan on. A page turner, that draws you into empathizing a anti-hero.

The deal is aimed at strengthening Apple's on-device machine learning capabilities, which will allow iPhones and iPads to process data locally without having to send it to the cloud.  Xnor.ai was founded in 2017 by five researchers from the University of Washington who specialised in computer vision and machine learning. The company developed low-power AI technology that can run on devices with limited processing power, such as cameras, wearables, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  The acquisition gives Apple access to Xnor.ai's expertise in edge computing, which refers to the processing of data close to where it is generated, rather than sending it to a central server or data centre. This approach offers several benefits, including faster processing times, improved security, and reduced reliance on network connectivity

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Stir in spinach; cook 2 minutes or until spinach wilts, stirring frequently. Remove from heat.  Add pasta, chicken, cheese, salt, and pepper to spinach mixture; toss gently to combine. Divide pasta mixture among 4 plates; sprinkle each serving with almonds.  This looks delicious! I love anything with spinach and almonds. Thanks for sharing!  Thanks for stopping by my blog and leaving a comment. This dish looks wonderful.

A: I was really disappointed with this place. The food was mediocre at best and the service was just plain bad. Our waiter took forever to take our order, bring our drinks, and deliver our food.

Input:  Darinka_Dentcheva  influencedBy  Andrzej_Piotr_Ruszczyński ,  Darinka_Dentcheva  professionalField  Mathematical_optimization   Output:   The first thing I did when I got home from work today was to make myself a cup of tea and sit down to read through my blog comments. It's something I look forward to every day, but today there was one particular comment that really made me smile.  It was from a lovely lady called Sharon who told me how much she enjoys reading my blog and then went on to tell me about her own journey with breast cancer. Her story is very similar to mine in many ways, so I felt compelled to write back to her and let her know that she isn't alone.  That got me thinking about how important it is for people to share their stories. When we open up and talk about our experiences, whether it's good or bad, it can often help us to feel less alone.  As humans, we have a natural desire to connect with others and when we share our stories, it creates a bond between us. It gives others the opportunity to relate to what we've been through and also allows them to offer support and encouragement.  When I first found out I had breast cancer, I didn't know anyone else who had gone through the same thing. I felt very isolated and scared. However, as I started to share my story with others, I began to meet other women who had also been diagnosed with breast cancer. Hearing their stories gave me comfort and hope. It helped me to realise that I wasn't

Lexus has released the first details and images of its upcoming LF-CC concept car, which will make its world debut at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show next month.  The LF-CC stands for Lexus Future Coupé Concept and is said to preview a new coupe model that will join the automaker's lineup later this year.  In terms of styling, the LF-CC takes many cues from the LF-LC concept unveiled last year at the 2012 Detroit Auto Show. It features a similar spindle grille, sharp headlights, aggressive front bumper, low roofline, floating roof design, muscular haunches, and sleek tail lights.  The interior of the LF-CC is described as offering a driver-focused cockpit environment, with all controls oriented towards the driver. The cabin also features plenty of soft-touch materials, including wood and leather, as well as high-tech touches such as a large central display screen.  Under the hood is likely to be a version of Lexus' new 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder

The main event is that I moved back to my home country, Poland. It was a difficult decision for me because I really enjoyed living in Germany, but at the same time there were some personal issues that forced me to move back.  Since then I have been working as a freelance translator and sometimes also as a proofreader/editor. I am very happy with this job because it allows me to work from home and spend more time with my family. I can also choose which projects I want to work on, so I don't have to do anything that I don't like.  In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and learning new things. Lately, I have been interested in psychology and philosophy, so I have been reading a lot of books on those subjects.  That's all for now. I will try to post more regularly in the future.

We were excited to try this place out because we love sushi and thought it would be a nice break from our normal sushi restaurant.  When we walked in, there weren't too many people inside so we were seated right away.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  She gave us plenty of time to look over the menu before taking our order.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura bento box and I got the spicy tuna roll and a california roll.  The food came out pretty fast.  The presentation was good but the taste wasn't what we expected.  The rolls were bland and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was undercooked and hard.  The shrimp tempura in my boyfriend's bento box was soggy.  The miso soup was decent but nothing special.  Overall, the food wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't worth the price we paid.  We probably won't be coming back.  Q: negative  A: This place is a waste of time. They have absolutely no idea what they're doing. They don't know how to do pedicures, and their polish jobs are horrendous

Article: What do you usually do after school? Play sports? Watch TV? Let's see how kids in foreign countries spend their free time? Mess around  in the UK At 4:30 pm, most British kids leave school and go home. Homework is rare at this age. So they usually have a lot of free time in the evening. They often spend this time on sports activities or clubs. Swimming, cycling, hiking, and horse riding are very popular in countryside areas. Lots of activities take place at school, such as music clubs, photography clubs, theater groups and dance groups. Formal art classes are rare, so many kids learn art just by drawing and painting at home, and talents often emerge unexpectedly. Get a part-time job! You're old enough to get a job at 14 in Britain, as there's no child labor law. But most kids wait until they're 15 or 16. Schoolmates are important but best friends are not easy to find.

When we got there, we were seated right away. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. However, the food was disappointing. We both ordered steaks medium rare.

The sides were nothing special either. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came out of a box and the creamed spinach lacked flavor.

A: I was really excited to try this place out since I love sushi so much but I was quite disappointed. First off, we had reservations for 7:30pm and didn't get seated until 8:15pm. The restaurant wasn't even full. When we were finally seated, our waiter took forever to come over to our table. We ordered the all you can eat sushi special ($26.95 per person) which comes with appetizers, sushi, and dessert. For our appetizers, we ordered the seaweed salad, gyoza, and edamame. The seaweed salad was good, but the gyoza and edamame were mediocre. For our sushi rolls, we ordered the Spicy Tuna Roll, Philly Roll, California Roll, Rainbow Roll, and Sweet Shrimp Tempura Roll. All of them were just okay. They weren't bad, but they weren't great either. The sweet shrimp tempura roll was the best one out of all of them. Our waiter never came back to ask us if we wanted more sushi, so we ended up not ordering anymore. For dessert, we ordered the green tea creme brulee and the red bean ice cream

"Units of the Eastern Military District have taken control of the administrative buildings of Soledar," the ministry said in a statement.  Ukrainian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.  Soledar, with a pre-war population of around 10,000, is located just north of the more strategically important city of Bakhmut, which Russia has been trying to capture for months.  Reuters was unable to independently verify battlefield reports.  Bakhmut and Soledar are both located in the Donetsk region, one of two provinces that make up the industrial heartland of the Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.  In November, Russia's Wagner Group, a private military contractor led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said its forces had entered

It has revolutionized the way we communicate, share information, and connect with others. However, despite its many benefits, social media can also have a negative impact on our mental health. In this blog post, we will explore some of the ways in which social media can affect our mental well-being and offer some tips for maintaining a healthy relationship with these platforms.  1. Comparison and Low Self-Esteem: Social media often presents a curated and idealized version of people's lives. The constant exposure to carefully crafted images and status updates can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. It's important to remember that what we see on social media isn't always an accurate reflection of reality.  2. Anxiety and Depression: Overuse of social media has been linked to increased levels of anxiety and depression. The constant need for validation through likes, comments, and followers can create a vicious cycle of seeking external approval. This can contribute to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and dissatisfaction with one's own life.  3. Cyberbullying and Harassment: Social media provides a platform for cyberbullying and online harassment. Being subjected to such negative behavior can have a profound impact on mental health, causing distress, anger, and even post-traum

Input:  The_Two_Towers  author  J._R._R._Tolkien   Output:   Q: How do I get the value of the last element in a list? I have a list with integers and I want to get the value of the last element in the list.  How do I do that?  A: Use the -1 index:  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]  last_element = my_list[-1]  print(last_element)  Output:  4  A: You can access the last element of a list by using negative indexing.  Example:  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]  last_element = my_list[-1]  print(last_element)  Output:  4  Explanation:  In Python, list indexing starts from 0. When you use a negative index, it counts from the end of the list. So, -1 will refer to the last element of the list.

He's absorbed in the pages of a book, his fingers lightly tracing the words as he reads.  I hesitate for a moment, wanting to give him space, but the sight of him brings a smile to my lips. I clear my throat softly, catching his attention. He looks up, his bright blue eyes meeting mine, and a warm smile spreads across his face.  "Morning," he says, gesturing for me to join him.  I make my way over, taking a seat opposite him. "Good morning," I reply, settling into the chair.  He glances at the coffee pot on the table between us, and I nod towards it. He pours me a cup, adding just the right amount of sugar and cream before passing it to me.  We sit in comfortable silence for a while, lost in our thoughts as we sip our coffee. Eventually, he breaks the quiet, asking about my dreams and aspirations. I tell him about the novel I've been working on, the characters and storyline that have been dancing in my head for months.

I have a function that returns the cosine similarity between two documents. What I want to do is to run this function multiple times with different arguments (two different documents each time) and store the result in a list.  For example:  def cosine_similarity(doc1, doc2):      # Calculate the cosine similarity between doc1 and doc2      pass  docs = [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4]  similarities = []  # Run cosine_similarity for all pairs of documents and store the results in similarities  for i in range(len(docs)-1):      for j in range(i+1, len(docs)):          similarities.append(cosine_similarity(docs[i], docs[j]))  Is there a more efficient way to do this without using nested loops?  A: You can use itertools.combinations to generate all pairs of documents and then use list comprehension to calculate the similarities:  from itertools import combinations  def cosine_similarity(doc1, doc2):      # Calculate the cosine similarity between doc1 and doc2      pass  docs = ['doc1', 'doc2', 'doc3',

Q: negative  A: Worst customer service ever. I can't even begin to tell you how awful this place is. They don't care about their customers at all. My husband and I went in to get his phone fixed because the screen was broken. It took them two weeks to fix it. When we finally got it back, it still didn't work. So we took it back in for them to fix it again. That time it took them three weeks. When we finally got it back, it was fixed but they charged us $300 when they told us it would only be $150. When my husband asked them about the extra $150 they said "we forgot to tell you". Are you kidding me? Never going back!

He is growing up, with a brother who is a paraplegic, and a dad who has been through WWII and a mum who tries to keep them together. Simon learns about the Aborigines and their way of life, while questioning his own, throwing in what is right and what is wrong. The book brings to light the treatment of the Aborigines by the whites, and the story keeps you captivated. You will enjoy this book immensely.

The plot was weak and so poorly developed I had to force myself to watch it through to the end. The only reason I did it because I wanted to know if it was going to get any better and it didn't, I was left even more disappointed in the end. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

This study used quantitative research methods to analyze the data collected from a sample of middle school mathematics teachers. Data were collected through a survey consisting of two questionnaires: one measuring teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and the other measuring teachers' use of cooperative learning strategies. After analyzing the data using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, the results indicated that there was a significant positive relationship between teachers' self-efficacy beliefs and their use of cooperative learning strategies. Based on these findings, recommendations for future research and implications for practice were discussed.

A: This place is overpriced for what you get. The food is mediocre at best. I came here for my birthday dinner with my family. We had a party of 10 and they put us in the back room which was nice. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She made sure our drinks were always full and took our orders promptly. The bread they brought out was good but nothing special. They also brought out some kind of bean dip which was pretty tasty. For my entree I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It was just ok. The pasta was cooked well but the sauce was bland and watery. The chicken was dry and tasteless. My husband ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. He said it was just ok too. The meatballs weren't very flavorful. The kids all got the spaghetti with butter and parmesan. They seemed to enjoy it. All in all this place wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I don't think we will be coming back.  Q: negative  A: Went there last night for the first time.  Ordered two pizzas one with pepperoni and sausage and the other with mushrooms and peppers.

The study, published in the journal Developmental Psychology, found that adolescents who spent more time using social media reported higher levels of loneliness and lower self-esteem.  Researchers at the University of Haifa in Israel examined the relationship between social media use and emotional development among adolescents aged 13 to 17 years old. The researchers analyzed data collected from two waves of a longitudinal study conducted by the Israeli Center for Developmental Psychology.  In the first wave, students completed questionnaires assessing their social media use, loneliness, and self-esteem. In the second wave, one year later, they were asked to complete the same questionnaires.  The results showed that adolescents who used social media more intensively also reported higher levels of loneliness and lower self-esteem over time.  "These findings suggest that social media use is associated with poorer emotional development during adolescence," said Dr. Gal Gabay, lead author of the study. "While we cannot infer causality from this study, our findings indicate that excessive social media use might have negative consequences for emotional well-being."  The researchers note that

First, the writing style is quite archaic, even stilted in places. It reminded me of some of the old "diet" books of the 1970's.

For many people, one of their top priorities is to improve their financial situation. Here are some practical steps you can take to achieve financial success in 2023.  1. Create a budget: Start by tracking your income and expenses to understand where your money is going. Based on this analysis, create a realistic budget that allocates funds for essential expenses, debt repayment, savings, and discretionary spending.  2. Pay off debt: High-interest debts such as credit card balances and personal loans can significantly impact your financial health. Make a plan to pay off these debts as quickly as possible by increasing your monthly payments or focusing on the debt with the highest interest rate first.  3.

This fund will provide a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or job loss.  4. Invest for the future: Start investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to grow your wealth over time. Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a long-term investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.  5.

A recent survey by Willis Towers Watson found that 80% of executives plan to allow employees to work remotely at least some of the time post-pandemic, up from 27% before the crisis. But how can HR leaders navigate the transition to a more flexible work environment?  More companies are embracing remote work for good reason: It can improve employee satisfaction, productivity and retention, according to experts. However, there are also challenges associated with remote work, such as maintaining company culture and managing employee well-being.  In order to successfully implement a flexible work policy, HR leaders must consider several factors, including communication strategies, technology infrastructure, performance management practices and talent acquisition strategies. By addressing these areas, organizations can lay the groundwork for a successful transition to a more flexible work environment.

Needless to say, we didn't want cables/wires showing. We ran the wires/cable box through the attic and needed a bracket to push the TV away from the wall to cover the gap between the TV and the wall. After spending way too much time and effort looking for such an item locally, I figured I'd search Amazon. Found this product, which exactly met my needs, at a great price. Thanks, Amazon!

With billions of people using social media platforms every day, it presents a massive opportunity for small businesses to connect with their target audience. However, creating a successful social media marketing strategy requires careful planning and execution. In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to create an effective social media marketing strategy for your small business.  Identify Your Target Audience  The first step in creating a successful social media marketing strategy is to identify your target audience. This includes understanding their age, gender, location, interests, and pain points. By knowing who your ideal customer is, you can tailor your content and messaging to resonate with them more effectively.  Select the Right Platforms  Not all social media platforms are created equal, and what works for one business may not work for another. Once you have identified your target audience, research which social media platforms they frequent the most. For example, if your target audience is millennials, Instagram and Snapchat might be the best platforms for your business. On the other hand, if your target audience is baby boomers, Facebook and LinkedIn

Input:  Lady_Anne_Monson  birthPlace  Darlington ,  Lady_Anne_Monson  birthPlace  Kingdom_of_England   Output:   [2018-09-14] Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a chemical compound, a very reactive form of hydrogen peroxide, used often as an oxidizer, bleaching agent or antiseptic. It is also found naturally in some organisms, where it acts as a signaling molecule. In this work, we have developed a new method to produce hydrogen peroxide by photocatalysis using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. The TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy and N2 adsorption measurements. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The results show that the TiO2 nanoparticles presented high photocatalytic activity with MB degradation up to 95% after 3 h of irradiation. The photocatalyst was then used for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water. The concentration of H2O2 was monitored by UV-Vis

I have two tables named table1 and table2. Both have the same column names but different data. I want to join these two tables and get the result in a new table.  A: You can use UNION ALL to combine the results of both tables into a single result set:  SELECT * FROM table1  UNION ALL  SELECT * FROM table2;  This will return all rows from both tables without removing any duplicates. If you want to remove duplicates, you can use UNION instead of UNION ALL.  However, if you want to perform a JOIN operation (which combines rows from two or more tables based on matching values in one or more columns), you can use the JOIN syntax:  SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, t2.column1, t2.column2  FROM table1 t1  INNER JOIN table2 t2  ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;  Replace column1, column2, common_column with the actual column names in your tables.

We all know that parental leave is important for new moms and dads, but did you know that it's also good for business? That's right – companies that offer paid parental leave have been shown to have higher productivity, lower turnover rates, and increased profitability. In other words, paid parental leave makes good business sense.  Despite this, the United States is one of only three countries in the world that doesn't require employers to offer paid maternity leave (the other two are Papua New Guinea and Suriname). And although some companies have started offering their own paid parental leave policies, many families still struggle to make ends meet when a new baby arrives.  This is why we need the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act. The FAMILY Act would create a national paid family and medical leave insurance program, so that workers could take time off to bond with a new child, care for a sick family member, or recover from their own serious health condition without worrying about losing their job or falling into debt.  The FAMILY Act has been introduced in both the House and Senate, but we need your help to build support for this critical legislation. Take action now by asking your members of Congress to co-sponsor the FAMILY Act. Together, we can

A: Food is good but the service is terrible. The waitress was very rude when we asked for a refill on our drinks. We also had to ask for silverware and napkins. Will not go back.  Q: negative  A: I went to this place with high hopes after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, I did not have the same experience.   First of all, the place is pretty dirty. It needs a deep cleaning. There were food crumbs all over the floor under the table. The walls need to be scrubbed down and the bathroom sink was clogged.   Secondly, the service was really slow. Our waitress took forever to take our order and bring us our food. At one point, she just disappeared for about 15 minutes. When we finally got our food, it wasn't even hot.   Lastly, the food itself was mediocre at best. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. The steak was dry and the gravy tasted like it came out of a can. The hash browns were soggy and the toast was burnt. My boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were hard and the gravy tasted like it was made with instant gravy mix.   Overall, I was really disappointed

Title: Very good but not perfect Review: Everything works fine, well designed and built except for one major exception: whoever designed this knew the clear plastic piece would eventually be lost, so they made the item unuseable without it. No mention of this fact is made in the advertising, and no source for replacing it is provided in the package. I guess they figure you just buy another new one, and that's an alright business model if you can get away with it.

Install it using npm i node-schedule.  After installing it, you can use it like this:  const schedule = require('node-schedule');  let job = schedule.scheduleJob('0 */5 * * *', () => {      client.channels.get("CHANNEL ID").send("MESSAGE");  });  This will run the function inside the arrow function every 5 minutes.

For example, it states that George W. Bush could have prevented the September 11 attacks by not taking off his coat on a visit to a school, because the press would have commented on the lack of his bulletproof jacket and he would then have been able to leave to go to the White House, where he could have directed the Secret Service to intercept the planes.This book gives no serious analysis of probability. Definitely not worth buying. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?  Answer:  unflattering

We went on a Saturday night around 8pm.  It wasn't busy at all.  We were seated right away.  Our waitress was very nice.  However, our food took forever to come out.  We ordered the sliders, truffle parmesan fries, and mac and cheese.  The sliders were pretty good but nothing special.  The fries were just ok.  The mac and cheese was bland.

Highly recommend this place!  Q: negative  A: Came here for lunch with my husband and wasn't impressed. We both ordered the chicken fried steak which came with one side. My husband got mashed potatoes and I got green beans. Both were just ok. The chicken fried steak was pretty good but the gravy was lacking flavor. The service was slow and our waitress seemed annoyed when we asked for refills on our drinks. Probably won't come back.

Answer: I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time now and finally had the chance last night.  It did not disappoint.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine.  We started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and the spinach artichoke dip.  Both were very good.  For dinner I had the pork chop and my wife had the salmon.  Both were excellent.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images  1. Online sales soar but high street footfall drops  The traditional start of the Christmas shopping season was always going to be different this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. As non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen after England's second national lockdown ended on 2 December, many consumers stayed away from the high street. Footfall across Britain's retail centres was down 49% compared with last year, according to data from Springboard.  Meanwhile, online sales boomed. In the week to 21 November, online spending rose by 68% compared with the same week last year, according to Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all credit and debit card transactions in the UK.  2.

The thought of being able to go back and change something, or see what the future holds, is both exciting and terrifying. But what if time travel was no longer just a concept in science fiction, but a reality? How would our world change?  Imagine being able to visit historical events as they unfolded. Witnessing the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the fall of the Berlin Wall, or the first steps on the moon would give us a new perspective on history. We could gain insights into the motivations and emotions of those who shaped our world. However, this also raises questions about the ethics of interfering with the past. Should we change the course of history, even if it means risking the destruction of our own timeline?  On the other hand, the ability to predict the future could revolutionize every aspect of our lives. We could prevent natural disasters, stop wars before they start, and avoid economic crashes. However, knowing the future could also take away our free will and make life feel meaningless. Would we still strive for greatness if we knew the outcome in advance?  Time travel could also have practical applications. Imagine being able to visit your older self for guidance or to seek advice from historical figures. It could also allow us to save loved ones who have passed away or reunite families separated by time.

Rose's mother Maria dies and leaves her daughter her farm and a sealed letter to be opened after Maria's death. Twelve-year-old Rose and her father travel to Austria to fulfill Maria's wish to have her ashes spread on the fields of her native village. The villagers refuse to recognize the family's ownership of the farm; however, a local lawyer explains that this is because they bear the same coat of arms on their family seal as did the previous landlord, the Marquis, who was killed in the Sino-Japanese War. The lawyer advises Rose's father to hide his family crest and file a court petition asserting his ownership of the land. If won, Rose and her father will become the new landowners. When the judge requests that Rose prove her father is her guardian, Rose seizes the opportunity to explore her mother's past. She sneaks out of the house to the local orphanage in search of answers about Maria's history. The orphanage archives are warded by a stern nun who forbids Rose from continuing her search, explaining that Maria was an unmarried mother and shunned by her (already disgraced) family when she left the religious order. However, the kind-hearted

The total budget is $573 million with an operating budget of $389 million and a capital improvement budget of $184 million.  "This year's budget was unique because we were coming out of a pandemic," said Mayor Joe Coviello. "We didn't know what revenues were going to look like."  The city council decided to keep the millage rate the same at 4.28 mills, which means homeowners will not see an increase in their property taxes.  "We don't want to raise taxes unless we have to," Coviello said. "We did not need to raise taxes this year."  The budget includes funding for new police officers and firefighters.

Americans could slash their diet-related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 49 percent if they reduced their meat consumption and ate more plant-based foods, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Food.  Researchers at the University of Michigan analyzed data on food production and consumption in the United States to estimate the climate impact of various dietary changes. They found that replacing beef with chicken, pork, or plant-based foods was the most effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing beef with chicken resulted in the largest emissions reduction, equivalent to taking 58 million cars off the road for a year.  The researchers also looked at the effect of adopting specific dietary patterns recommended by health organizations, such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the Mediterranean diet, and the Healthy Eating Plate. All of these diets were associated with significant reductions in greenhouse

One popular resolution is to improve one's financial situation. Whether that means saving more money, paying off debt, or investing wisely, there are several strategies that can help you achieve your financial goals in 2023.  1. Create a Budget: Start by creating a budget to understand where your money is going each month. This will help you identify areas where you can cut back on expenses and save more. Use a budgeting app or spreadsheet to track your income and expenses.  2. Pay Off Debt: High-interest debts like credit card balances can quickly drain your finances. Make a plan to pay off these debts as soon as possible. Consider using the debt snowball or debt avalanche method to tackle your debts systematically.  3. Increase Your Emergency Fund: An emergency fund is crucial for unexpected expenses or job loss. Aim to save enough to cover three to six months of living expenses. Put money into a high-yield savings account or a money market account.  4. Save for Retirement: Contributing to a retirement account like a 401(k) or an IRA can help you build wealth over time. Check if your employer offers a matching contribution program and take full advantage of it.  5. Invest Wisely:

Deborah Armstrong, D-Albuquerque  A New Mexico House committee approved a bill Tuesday that would ban licensed therapists from attempting to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of minors.  The Health and Human Services Committee voted 7-4 along party lines to approve House Bill 22, sponsored by Rep. Deborah Armstrong, D-Albuquerque.  Armstrong told the committee her bill is meant to protect young people from what she called "harmful" practices.  "We have a duty to protect our children," Armstrong said.  But some Republicans on the committee disagreed with Armstrong's assessment. Rep. Rebecca Dow, R-Truth or Consequences, said parents should have the right to make decisions for their children.  "This is a parental rights issue," Dow said.  Dow also questioned whether the practice was even happening in New Mexico.  "I don't know if there's a problem

Anyone heard of SPL Sound Field Processors?  I was looking for something to make my stereo mixes sound more spacious and came across these. They seem very interesting but I can't find any reviews or opinions on them. Does anyone have any experience with them?  I've heard of them, but haven't used one personally.  Thanks for the reply. I know they're pricey but I'm curious if they're worth it.  I've never used one either, but I think they're pretty highly regarded around here.  I just picked up a Vitalizer M-280 for $350 (including shipping) off of eBay. It's supposed to be similar to the Imager II, which is what I really wanted. I'll let you know how it turns out.  I have the Imager II and love it.  I also have the Surround, which is great for adding ambience to mono tracks.  The Imager II is probably the most useful reverb/ambience tool I own.  It's definitely worth the money.  I use both the Imager II and the Surround. Both are fantastic tools.  I have the Imager II and Surround. Both are amazing pieces of gear.

Input:  Pontiac_Rageous  assembly  Michigan   Output:   Problem: Write a negative (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) yelp review.  A: This place is absolutely disgusting! I can't believe they actually serve food this dirty.   The service was horrible. Our waitress was rude and acted like she didn't want to be there. We had to ask for refills on our drinks multiple times.   As for the food, we ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich and the turkey burger. The Philly cheese steak sandwich was drenched in grease and the meat tasted spoiled. The turkey burger was overcooked and dry. The fries were soggy and tasted like they were cooked in old oil.   Overall, this place is a complete waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else.  Q: negative  A: Went here with a group of friends for my birthday dinner. It wasn't busy so we got seated right away. However, it took forever to get our orders taken. Once we did order, the food came out pretty fast. The food was decent but nothing special. The only thing that stood out was the bread pudding dessert which was really good. My main issue was with the service. There were several times where we had to flag down our server just to get some water. At the end of the meal, he brought us the wrong bill.

Apple says Siri can understand more than 20,000 words and phrases, and its creators say they designed it to learn from experience.  “We’ve been working on this for over four years,” said Dag Kittlaus, one of Siri’s co-founders. “It’s something we’ve been passionate about.”  Mr. Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer, also a co-founder, met at SRI International, a nonprofit research institute in Menlo Park, Calif., where they worked on CALO, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency project intended to create a personalized artificial intelligence assistant.  In 2007, Mr. Kittlaus and Mr. Cheyer left SRI to start their own company, which they called Siri, after the Norse goddess of wisdom and prophecy. In April 2010, Apple bought Siri for a reported $200 million.  Apple was not the only technology company interested in Siri. Google, Microsoft and Facebook were all vying for the company, according to several people briefed on the negotiations.

Input:  Darinka_Dentcheva  influencedBy  Andrzej_Piotr_Ruszczyński ,  Darinka_Dentcheva  knownFor  Stochastic_programming   Output:   The latest version of the Android operating system, Android 8.0 Oreo, has been available since August 21, 2017. However, only a small percentage of devices have received the update so far. It is estimated that less than 1% of all Android devices currently run Android 8.0 Oreo.  The slow adoption rate of Android 8.0 Oreo can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the fragmented nature of the Android ecosystem means that updates must be developed and approved by both the device manufacturer and the carrier before being rolled out to users. This process can take several months or even over a year in some cases.  Secondly, not all devices are eligible for the update. Manufacturers typically only provide updates for their newer and higher-end devices, leaving many older and lower-end devices without access to the latest software.  Lastly, some users may choose not to update their devices due to compatibility issues with certain apps or concerns about battery life and performance.  In summary, the low adoption rate of Android 8.0 Oreo is primarily due to the fragmented nature of the Android ecosystem, limited availability of updates for certain devices, and user preferences.

Title: Disappointing Review: I am a big fan of Dean Koontz and have loved many of his books (Eleventh Commandment, Hideaway, Icebound), but this one was not up to what I have come to expect from him. The plot wasn't bad, but the stereotypical characters and stilted dialogue lessened the impact of the storyline significantly. I read many, many books and usually power through them in a couple of days, but this one took me almost two weeks to finish because I just didn't care. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. I won't be passing this one on to any friends.  dissatisfied  Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

The problem is you can find these few good ideas anywhere on the net for free. This book is mostly blank pages to record data and a bunch of ad's for the authors video's and other products.

I want to check if a string contains special characters (such as $, %, @, etc.) using regular expressions in Python.  How can I do this?  A: You can use re.search with a negative lookahead:  import re  def has_special_char(string):      return bool(re.search(r'(?=.*[^a-zA-Z0-9])', string))  print(has_special_char('abc')) # False  print(has_special_char('$abc')) # True  print(has_special_char('123')) # False  print(has_special_char('%123')) # True  Explanation:  *  *(?=...) is a zero-width positive lookahead assertion  *.* matches any character (except newline) any number of times  *[^a-zA-Z0-9] matches any character that is not a letter or digit  The regex searches for a position in the string where there is a non-alphanumeric character ahead. If such a position is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.  A: One way is to use a regular expression to match any character that is not alphanumeric

UNSMIS has played a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the six-point peace plan brokered by Kofi Annan, the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, and its continued presence is essential to support the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis.  However, UNSMIS needs to be strengthened so that it can fulfil its mandate effectively. This means increasing its size to at least 300 observers and providing them with adequate resources, including communications equipment and armoured vehicles. The Syrian authorities must facilitate the mission's work by granting it access to all parts of the country, including Damascus, Homs, Hama and Daraa.  The Security Council should also consider authorising UNSMIS to monitor violations of human

Q: negative  A: Went here for lunch today with a few coworkers. We arrived at around 12:30pm and there was no wait. However, by the time we were done eating, the place was packed. That's a good sign right? Not necessarily.  The service was terrible. Our waitress didn't seem to know what she was doing. When we asked her questions, she had to go ask someone else before giving us an answer. It took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our food. She also forgot to put in one of our orders. By the time we got our food, we were almost done with our meal.   As for the food, it was just okay. Nothing special. The sushi was meh. The shrimp tempura was soggy and tasted old. The teriyaki chicken was dry. The only thing I enjoyed was the seaweed salad.   Overall, I wouldn't come back here. There are much better sushi places in the area.

A: One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. I love the atmosphere and the food is always great. They have a fantastic wine list and the service is impeccable.  Q: negative  A: Ate here for lunch today with a group of 6. Service was good, but the food was just ok. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, vegetable korma, saag paneer, garlic naan, and basmati rice. The chicken tikka masala was very bland and didn't have much flavor. The lamb vindaloo was spicy, but had a strange sweetness to it. The saag paneer was pretty good, but nothing special. The vegetable korma was probably the best out of all the dishes we ordered. The garlic naan was also pretty good. All in all, the food was just ok. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything to write home about either.  Problem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:  - negative  - positive) review?  Answer: This place is awesome! Every time I come here I get exactly what I ask for. I came in looking for a specific type of dress

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Not good Review: I bought this item because it was convenient for me since I already use a SanDisk card for my camera. However, two different iPods (one nano and one touch) would not read this at all. The best I got was "this accessory is not optimized" on the iPod touch. I had downloaded music to it from my computer through iTunes. Also, this will not work without the cover inserted. I am better off just using my existing 2gb card even though it is not as much memory. This was a waste of money.  Answer:  dissatisfied

Input:  Kingdom_of_England  governmentType  Unitary_state ,  Lady_Anne_Monson  nationality  Kingdom_of_England   Output:   The world is at war, and only one man can stop it. But who is he? And what does he have to do with the ancient civilization of Atlantis? These are the questions that must be answered before it's too late.  As global tensions rise and conflicts erupt across the globe, a mysterious figure emerges. He has no name, no country, and no allegiance. All that is known about him is that he possesses extraordinary intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Wherever he goes, he brings peace and reconciliation. Nations that were once at each other's throats now shake hands and pledge to work together for a better future.  Intelligence agencies from around the world are scrambling to uncover the identity of this enigmatic figure. As they dig deeper, they stumble upon an ancient manuscript detailing the prophecy of a chosen one who will arise when the world is on the brink of destruction. This chosen one, according to the manuscript, is said to have ties to the lost civilization of Atlantis, a place of incredible knowledge and power.  The race is on to find the connection between the mysterious peacemaker and Atlantis. Scientists, historians, and archaeologists join forces to unravel the secrets of this long-forgotten civilization. They discover that Atlantis was far more advanced than previously thought, with technologies capable

The food is great and the service is always good. They have a wide variety of choices for all tastes. The price is right and the location is convenient.  Q: negative  A: Went here for lunch today with my wife and daughter. When we walked in there was no one at the hostess stand so we stood there for a few minutes before someone finally came over to greet us. We asked for a table outside and they said they were all reserved. So we settled for a table inside. Our waitress came over and took our drink order. My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and when it came out it was just a glass of ice with some sliced strawberries and a slice of lemon floating in it. No strawberry flavor whatsoever. She then ordered a side of ranch dressing for her salad. It came out in a small cup with only about a tablespoon of ranch in it. For $2.50 you would think they could give you a little more than that. My wife ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the chicken pot pie. The food came out pretty quick but wasn't very good. The fish and chips tasted like it was from the freezer section at Walmart. The chicken pot pie was ok but nothing special. Overall the food was below

Input:  Ciudad_Ayala  populationDensity  1604.0 ,  Ciudad_Ayala  isPartOf  Morelos   Output:   Q: Is there a way to make a custom listview with different layouts for each row? I want to make a listview where every row has a different layout. For example, the first row will have a textview and a button, the second row will have two textviews and so on.  Is there a way to do this without using adapters?  A: No, you can't do this without using an adapter.  Adapters are used to display different views for each item in the list. So if you want to have different layouts for each row, you need to create a custom adapter and override the getView() method to return the desired view for each position.  Here is an example of a simple custom adapter:  public class CustomAdapter extends ArrayAdapter<String> {      private Context context;      private List<String> items;      public CustomAdapter(Context context, List<String> items) {          super(context, R.layout.list_item, items);          this.context = context;          this.items = items;      }      @Override      public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {          LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);          int layoutResource

In 1835, there were 2,143 gallon tanks built into the walls of the barracks at Portsmouth and Plymouth. In 1853 an additional 63 tanks were installed. In 1863, a decision was made to expand this to include "all barrack rooms", including the Warrant Officers' and Officers' Quarters, and a further 104 tanks were installed. After the Ferro-Concrete Tank Company stopped making these, they were purchased through Brewers of Minworth. These tanks initially held up to 500 imperial gallons (2,300 L; 660 US gal) each; however, later modifications increased this capacity to about 700 imperial gallons (3,200 L; 850 US gal).The installation of the extra tanks resulted in some crowding of the barrack rooms and destruction of many of the original fireplaces. Subsequent modifications in the late 19th and early 20th century resulted in some rooms having the double rows of tanks partly removed. By 1907 there were 162 tanks in use, holding some 63,

Review: I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 months old. At first she didn't know what to do with it, but when the teacher showed her how to put the blocks in the holes, there was no stopping her. The blocks are all different shapes and have different sounds and textures which are great for sensory development. There are also additional blocks you can buy to increase the fun. The music is upbeat and not irritating either.  Answer: satisfied  Question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?

The Ellis Island Medals of Honor were created in 1986 by the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) to honor outstanding Americans who have distinguished themselves within their own ethnic groups while exemplifying the values of the American way of life. Each year, NECO selects individuals whose accomplishments in their respective fields and inspired service to our nation are particularly noteworthy.  Mr. Feinberg was recognized for his tireless efforts to save lives through bone marrow and blood stem cell transplantation. Diagnosed with leukemia in 1991, Mr. Feinberg received a life-saving bone marrow transplant from his sister, Sheri. As a result of this experience, he founded The Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation in 1991 to help others battling life-threatening illnesses find matching donors. Since its inception, Gift of Life has facilitated more than 6,000 transplants worldwide, making it the largest Jewish and one of the largest independent bone marrow registries in the world.  "It is

Input:  University_of_Cambridge  type  Research_university   Output:   Home » World News » Trump says he won't attend Biden's inauguration  Trump says he won't attend Biden's inauguration  Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said Friday he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, making him the first incumbent president in more than 150 years to skip his successor's swearing-in ceremony.  "To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th," Trump wrote in a tweet.  The decision comes after weeks of baseless claims by Trump and his allies that the election was stolen from him through widespread voter fraud, which has been repeatedly debunked by courts, state election officials and his own attorney general. Trump has refused to concede the election, and instead of preparing for a peaceful transition of power, he has continued to spread falsehoods about the vote and pursue legal efforts to overturn the results.  In the wake of Wednesday's violent pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol, however, some Republicans have called on the President to acknowledge Biden's victory and begin the transition.  On Friday morning, Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican and member of the Senate leadership, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" that Trump should address the nation and say

Andrew Cuomo's request to block a subpoena for documents related to his book "American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic."  The governor sought to quash a subpoena issued by the New York Attorney General's Office seeking documents related to the book, which details Cuomo's handling of the pandemic.  Acting State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Whelan ruled that the attorney general's investigation falls within the scope of its authority, according to a copy of the decision obtained by The Associated Press.  Cuomo had argued that the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an invasion of privacy.

Porsche has revealed its latest pair of lightweight sports cars, the 2016 Cayman GT4 and Boxster Spyder, at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. Both cars are powered by naturally aspirated flat-six engines and feature manual transmissions only.  The last time Porsche offered a naturally aspirated flat-six engine in one of its sports cars was with the 997-generation 911 Carrera S, which was discontinued in 2012. Since then, Porsche's sports cars have been fitted with turbocharged flat-six engines.  But for these two new models, Porsche has reverted back to a naturally aspirated engine due to the purity of the driving experience it provides. The engine is a 3.8-liter unit developed from the one found in the 991-generation 911 Carrera S but tuned to deliver 385 horsepower and 309 pound-feet of torque. This is up from the 330 hp and 273 lb-

Input:  English_Without_Tears  writer  Anatole_de_Grunwald   Output:   This project was created on 03/26/2015 and last updated 4 years ago.  The goal of this project is to create a low-cost open-source Arduino shield that can be used to interface with various types of sensors and actuators. It will also have wireless communication capabilities using either XBee radios or Bluetooth modules.  For now, I am focusing on the hardware side of things. The design for the first version of the shield is complete and I am currently waiting for the PCB fabrication process to finish. Once I receive the boards, I will test them and release the Gerber files and schematics.  Once the hardware is finalized, I will start working on the firmware and software.  Here are some pictures of the finished PCB prototype.  After several months of work, I finally managed to get my hands on a working prototype of the shield.  It works as intended and has been tested with various sensors and actuators.  The next step is to refine the design and make it more compact. After that, I will create a BOM and document the assembly process.  Finally, I will release the Gerber files and schematics so that anyone can build their own shield.  Thank you for your support and stay tuned for further updates!  This board looks very interesting. Have you considered adding a MOSFET driver circuit for controlling

He was bedridden for two years before he passed away. My father used to tell me that he wants to die but he doesn't have the courage to do so. That inspired me to make Guzaarish."

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has taken enforcement action against Fidelity Investments for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  According to the DOL, Fidelity failed to disclose conflicts of interest associated with its brokerage window services, which allowed participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans to purchase securities outside of the plan's investment lineup. Specifically, Fidelity did not disclose material conflicts of interest arising from its provision of brokerage window services to employee benefit plans, including that it received revenue sharing payments from certain mutual fund companies when plan participants purchased their funds through the brokerage window.  The DOL says Fidelity also failed to fulfill its fiduciary duties under ERISA by selecting substandard share classes of mutual funds for inclusion in the investment lineups of participant-directed individual account plans without adequately considering lower-cost share classes
