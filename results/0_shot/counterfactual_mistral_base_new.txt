I would suggest double-checking the source of this information for accuracy.  Despite this inconsistency, it is known that Nadal was born in the late 18th century. Unfortunately, the triples also indicate that Nadal died on June 14, 1994, in Mexico, making it impossible for him to be a contemporary tennis player, as Rafael Nadal, a well-known tennis player, was born in 1985. The nationality of Rafael Nadal, according to these triples, is Mexican.
