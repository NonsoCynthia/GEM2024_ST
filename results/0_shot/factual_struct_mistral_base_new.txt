Its orbital period is 1249.6 days, which equates to approximately 3 years, 4 months, and 18 days. The semi-major axis of its orbit is calculated from this period and is equal to 1249.6 days divided by 365.25 (the average number of days in a year). This results in a semi-major axis of approximately 35,700,000 kilometers. Using Kepler's third law of planetary motion, we can calculate the orbital elements. The semi-major axis corresponds to the average distance between the celestial body and its star. The eccentricity describes the shape of the orbit, with a value close to 0 indicating a nearly circular orbit and a value closer to 1 indicating an elliptical orbit. The eccentricity for 1147_Stavropolis is unknown. However, we can calculate the semi-minor axis as the semi-major axis multiplied by the square root of (1 - eccentricity^2). With an assumed circular orbit (eccentricity = 0), the semi-minor axis is equal to the semi-major axis. Therefore, the semi-minor axis is approximately 35,700,000 kilometers. The semi-latus rectum is equal to the square of the semi-major axis divided by the standard gravitational parameter of the central body. For 1147_Stavropolis orbiting the Sun, the standard gravitational parameter is approximately 1.327 x 10^20 m^3/s^2. Thus, the semi-latus rectum is approximately 1.13 x 10^13 meters. The eccentric anomaly, mean anomaly, and longitude of the ascending node are also unknown. The argument of periapsis is equal to the longitude of the periapsis, which is calculated as the mean anomaly at the time of periapsis plus the longitude of the ascending node. Since the longitude of the ascending node is unknown, the argument of periapsis is also unknown. The inclination is the angle between the orbital
