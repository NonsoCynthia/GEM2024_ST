Using Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, we can determine that Frumman's orbital elements are as follows: its aphelion, or farthest point from its star, is at a distance of 3943.99 astronomical units (AU), and its perihelion, or closest point to its star, is at 5021.34 AU. With this data, we can also estimate Frumman's absolute magnitude, which is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, to be 599.41.
