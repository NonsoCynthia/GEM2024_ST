Based on the conversation between a Geospatial Analyst and a Machine Learning Engineer, they are working on a project related to geospatial data analysis.   They have three sets of geospatial data:   1. A set of countries and their respective leaders.  2. A set of airports and their respective locations.  3. A set of football clubs and their respective teams.  Using this data, they want to build a machine learning model that can predict certain attributes about these entities based on other attributes.  Here are the rules they've come up with:  1. For the countries and leaders, the model should be able to predict the leader's name, the country's name, and the capital city.  2. For the airports and locations, the model should be able to predict the airport's name, the city's name, and the country's name.  3. For the football clubs and teams, the model should be able to predict the club's name, the team's name, and the country's name.  Question: Using the property of transitivity, inductive logic, tree of thought reasoning, proof by exhaustion, proof by contradiction, and direct proof, how would you structure the machine learning model?
