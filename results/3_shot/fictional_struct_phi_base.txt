These countries are Turkey, Belgium, and Russia. They are each represented by a diplomat - one from Turkey, one from Belgium, and one from Russia.  Here are some clues:  1. The Turkish diplomat didn't speak French.  2. The Belgian diplomat didn't speak Russian.  3. The Russian diplomat didn't speak Turkish.  Question: Which language did each diplomat speak?  From the first clue, we know that the Turkish diplomat didn't speak French. This means the Turkish diplomat must have spoken either Russian or Turkish.  From the second clue, we know that the Belgian diplomat didn't speak Russian. This means the Belgian diplomat must have spoken either French or Turkish.  From the third clue, we know that the Russian diplomat didn't speak Turkish. This means the Russian diplomat must have spoken either French or Russian.  Since no diplomat can speak more than one language, we can deduce that the Turkish diplomat spoke Russian, the Belgian diplomat spoke French, and the Russian diplomat spoke Turkish.  Answer: The Turkish diplomat spoke Russian, the Belgian diplomat spoke French, and the Russian diplomat spoke Turkish.

Your task is to build a cloud-based system that can automatically generate summaries about different places around the world. The system should be able to understand the meaning of sentences and extract relevant information from them.  To accomplish this, you have decided to use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) capabilities. You have already trained your model on a large dataset of sentences describing various locations and their characteristics.  However, during the testing phase, you encountered a challenge. Some sentences contain ambiguous information that could be interpreted in multiple ways. For example, consider the following sentence:  "Atatürk_Monument_(İzmir) material 'Bronze', Atatürk_Monument_(İzmir) inaugurationDate '1932-07-27' [/SNT] [SNT] Atatürk_Monument_(İzmir) location Turkey, Turkey capital Ankara, Turkey largestCity Istanbul [/SNT] [SNT] Turkey leaderName Ahmet_Davutoğlu, Turkey currency Turkish_lira [/SNT]   Your NLP model correctly
